Add one representation task requiring ${focus.representation}.\n4. End with one explanation prompt about why the method works.\n\n**Completion checks:**\n- Each answer shows the algebraic rule, representation choice, or property used.\n- One item includes ${focus.trap}.\n- The final check confirms the answer through ${focus.check}.`,
				`**Project goal:** Create a short practice set for ${module.title} that separates procedure, representation, and interpretation. The set builds confidence with ${focus.routine} before adding a transfer case.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Present one model problem with the setup and answer check visible.\n2. Add one routine problem, one changed-context problem, and one explanation-only prompt.\n3. Include a representation change: ${focus.representation}.\n4. Add a one-sentence reflection naming the easiest place to make an error.\n\n**Completion checks:**\n- The worked example explains the transformation instead of only listing steps.\n- The changed-context problem includes ${focus.trap}.\n- The answer key includes reasoning, not only final values.`,
				`**Project goal:** Build a retrieval-and-transfer checkpoint for ${module.title}. The checkpoint reviews the core rule, then proves the rule still works when the representation or context changes.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Define the mathematical idea in one sentence using precise algebra vocabulary.\n2. Solve one direct case focused on ${focus.routine}.\n3. Convert the same idea into another form through ${focus.representation}.\n4.

Add two routine problems and one problem containing ${focus.trap}.\n4. Add a justification question that asks why the selected method fits the problem.\n\n**Completion checks:**\n- Solutions include enough intermediate work to locate arithmetic, algebra, or representation mistakes.\n- At least one prompt requires ${focus.check}.\n- The closing note names the misconception most likely to affect the next module.`

Solve the corrected version and include this check: ${focus.check}.\n4.

Complete the calculation or graph analysis, then use this check: ${focus.check}.\n4. Add one changed condition and predict how the answer or graph changes.\n\n**Completion checks:**\n- Work for ${module.title} separates given information, representation, operations, and interpretation.\n- A flawed step, unreasonable answer, or alternate representation is discussed explicitly.\n- The final statement explains why the answer fits the situation.`,

Add one comparison explaining why another representation or shortcut is weaker for this problem.\n\n**Completion checks:**\n- The task includes a meaningful constraint such as unit, domain, scale, rate, boundary, or precision.\n- The representation choice is defended and compared with another possible approach.\n- The closing explanation names the mathematical reason the answer or correction is trustworthy.`

						"**Readiness check:** Java Level 3 functions as real application work: packages, NIO Path/Files, streams or well-structured loops, exceptions, tests, generics, simple concurrency boundaries, and maintainable command-line behavior. The gate is satisfied when code organization, error handling, and test fixtures are visible enough that the project can grow without becoming one large main method.\n\n**Readiness evidence:** A medium-size Java project has a clear source-root layout, named package boundaries, model or service classes that can run without terminal input, and at least one reproducible test fixture or manual test transcript. Error handling reports what failed and where, not only print a stack trace and continue.\n\n**Evidence target:** A project demonstrates how Java organizes a medium-size program, not just how individual syntax features work."

					title: "Files, Streams, and Tests",
					content:
						"**Concept path:** Use local files and deterministic fixtures to practice data loading, transformation, aggregation, and reporting. Streams are useful when they clarify the data pipeline; loops remain appropriate when they make state or error handling clearer.\n\n**Fixture routine:** Keep at least four fixtures: empty input, malformed input, normal input, and larger input. The loader returns useful errors or validation results instead of crashing deep inside the program. The transformation code is testable without rereading files, and the report step does not mutate the parsed data unexpectedly.\n\n**Evidence target:** The implementation covers empty input, malformed input, normal input, and one larger input without changing the public API."

Architecture is justified by the change story, not by pattern vocabulary. A useful extension point has a stable interface, at least two implementations, and a small driver that does not need to know each implementation's internals.\n\n**Design test:** Before adding an extension mechanism, name the future change it supports. Good examples include adding a new file parser, report formatter, scoring rule, command, or validation strategy. Weak examples are extensions that only rename a class or move the same hard-coded conditional into a different file.\n\n**Evidence target:** Adding a new processor, command, or report type does not require rewriting the application driver."

Keep rejected rows or unreadable files visible in the report instead of silently dropping them.\n\n**Completion checks:**\n- File errors are handled clearly.\n- Tests cover empty, small, malformed, and larger inputs.\n- The final note explains the data model, API boundary, and one performance tradeoff."

It is a better fit when the goal is backend, tools, data processing, or AP-plus Java depth.\n\n**Scope rules:** Put business rules in services or model classes, not in terminal prompts. Keep file loaders separate from validation and reporting. Define command behavior for normal input, missing data, malformed data, and repeated operations. The CLI exposes the model, and it is not the only place where the model can run.\n\n**Evidence target:** The visible behavior can be tested without clicking through a graphical interface."

Keep event handlers short: read input, call model or service behavior, then render the result or error. Use observable state only where the view needs to react.

Add a visible empty state and a validation message so the interface is understandable before any data exists.\n\n**Completion checks:**\n- Add, edit, delete, filter, and empty-state behavior are visible.\n- Model logic is separated from controller/view code.\n- Saved data reloads correctly after restart."

Create or document a local build profile with target platform, scene list, output folder, and any required quality or input settings.\n4. Run the gate from a clean editor state and record command path, menu path, or screenshot evidence.\n5. Add one failure mode and recovery note, such as missing scene in build settings, compile error, package mismatch, or test assembly setup.\n\n**Completion checks:**\n- Tests run from a documented path.\n- The build profile is named and reproducible.\n- Scene boot and one gameplay state transition are verified.\n- A failure mode and recovery step are recorded."

The starter and review states use full project structure so scenes, packages, project settings, prefabs, scripts, tests, and attribution files can be inspected together. A clean project boundary also makes it possible to compare the current full-project baseline with what changed by the review state.\n\n**Repository parts:** A complete project includes `ProjectSettings`, `Packages/manifest.json`, `Packages/packages-lock.json`, source scripts, scenes, prefabs or stand-in assets, tests where available, `THIRD_PARTY_ASSETS.md`, and Git LFS rules for large binary assets. The starter state opens cleanly without completed solution logic. The review state demonstrates the intended final behavior and validation path.\n\n**Evidence target:** The linked starter state can be cloned, opened, played, tested, and built."

The start tag shows the provided baseline, the checkpoint tag preserves a useful midpoint, and the review tag shows the completed behavior. Tags are not arbitrary backups; they are reference points for review, recovery, and comparing design choices.\n\n**Evidence target:** Starter, checkpoint, and completed states can be compared without guessing which folder is current."

Keep optional polish separate from required mechanics so the vertical slice remains finishable.\n\n**Completion checks:**\n- Scope is small enough for a vertical slice.\n- The project has a test or smoke-check path.\n- Attribution and package/version notes are present.\n- The final demo explains architecture, one hard bug, and the evidence that the build can be reproduced."

A checkpoint can be a commit, tag, pull request, screenshot plus note, or recorded build output, but it must identify the project state clearly enough to resume later.\n\n**Evidence target:** Each development cycle produces a visible checkpoint and next action."
