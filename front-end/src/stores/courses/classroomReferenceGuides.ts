				"**Concept path:** This optional asset-free example demonstrates named input callbacks, a left-click guard, persistent score, delayed feedback and cancelling old callbacks on reset. The separate tile helper uses a finite grid and rejects an impossible layout.\n\n**Practice path:** Confirm a separate reference import. Press Enter, compare left/right/outside clicks, wait for feedback and reset before its callback. Read the linked guide before transferring one idea to the saved learner game. Keep Golf and Number Count attempts separate.\n\n**Verification:** One valid click changes the score once; redraws do not. Reset restores the ready screen. Tile placement respects actual dimensions and reports overcrowding."

The browser supplies the demonstrated API.\n\n**Practice path:** Confirm a separate reference import and run main.py in Python mode. Play and download the generated PySynth: course_melody.wav result. Predict one duration change, make it, and compare the whole sequence. Read the linked guide for note spellings, denominators and downloads.\n\n**Verification:** Hear the initial C, rest, G and final high C in order. Keep the learner Song Generator separate and validate its input rather than relying on fallback values."

The site Java preview does not provide a full JDK or record compilation.\n\n**Verification:** Predict and compare both score lines, the copied and shared tag lists, and rejection of a negative score.
