The integral test requires a positive continuous decreasing function agreeing with the terms; its tail integrals bound the remainder. The absolute-value ratio test gives absolute convergence for L<1 and divergence for L>1; L=1 is inconclusive. An alternating series converges when its term magnitudes decrease to 0, with error at most the next omitted magnitude. Absolute convergence means the absolute-value series converges; conditional convergence means the original series converges while that absolute-value series diverges.",

			"A Taylor polynomial about a is `P_N(x)=sum from k=0 to N of f^(k)(a)*(x-a)^k/k!`, with `0!=1`. The infinite Taylor series represents f where its remainder tends to 0; convergence of a formal series alone is not that identification. The radius of a power series can be 0 (only the center), infinite (all real inputs), or a finite positive R. In the last case the open interval is (a-R,a+R), and each endpoint must be tested separately. Differentiation and integration term by term preserve the radius inside that interval, not automatic endpoint behavior. Basic Maclaurin series are `1/(1-x)=sum x^n` for abs(x)<1; `e^x=sum x^n/n!`; `sin(x)=sum (-1)^n*x^(2n+1)/(2n+1)!`; `cos(x)=sum (-1)^n*x^(2n)/(2n)!`; `ln(1+x)=sum (-1)^(n+1)*x^n/n`; and `arctan(x)=sum (-1)^n*x^(2n+1)/(2n+1)`. The geometric, exponential, sine, cosine and arctangent sums start at n=0; the logarithm sum starts at n=1. The exponential and trig series converge for all real x. The log and arctangent formulas first follow on abs(x)<1, with endpoints checked separately. If f has continuous derivatives through order N+1 and the absolute (N+1)st derivative is bounded by M between a and x, Taylor error is at most `M*abs(x-a)^(N+1)/(N+1)!`. An applicable alternating-series bound can be sharper.",

Using the valid bound `e^t<=6/5` on [0,0.1], the fourth-derivative error bound is `(6/5)*(1/10)^4/24=1/200000`.

A finite sum can approximate a function only after identifying the appropriate function series and justifying its convergence there.

Geometric and telescoping structures can supply exact sums, while an integral test usually settles convergence or bounds rather than giving the exact series sum.",
