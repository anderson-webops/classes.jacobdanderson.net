					title: "Packages, Virtual Environments, and Lightweight Testing",

						"Use a virtual environment, a simple `tests/` folder, and at least one repeatable run command before the first real pattern lab begins. Learn that safe refactoring depends on a stable workflow, not just on good intentions."

					title: "Positioning against Python 2, Python 3, and the Java Track",

					title: "Pattern Names as Compression, Not Decoration",

The habit is diagnosis first, pattern name second."

Add a small pattern-journal template with columns for design pressure, simplest Python feature, possible pattern name, and verification evidence. The final snapshot makes clear how future labs will be run, tested, and compared before any pattern names are introduced."

				{
					title: "When the Textbook Form Still Helps",
					content:
						"Do not overcorrect into 'never use patterns in Python'. Explicit patterns still help when state, extension pressure, third-party integration, or team readability justify them. The useful question is whether the pattern makes the next change safer and clearer than a direct function or small module would. Keep the textbook form when it names stable roles, isolates an external system, or makes variation explicit; simplify it when the class structure only adds ceremony without changing the behavior or maintenance story. A good comparison shows the simple version first, then explains the concrete pressure that made the pattern worthwhile."
