					title: "Normalize File-Based Local Development Early",
					content:
						"The course uses real project folders on disk rather than only browser playgrounds. The editor is important, but the core habit is learning to manage files, terminals, local servers, and project structure in a way that prepares the work for frameworks, back ends, hosting, and team collaboration."
				},
				{
					title: "Preferred IDEs and Core Extensions",
					content:
						"`WebStorm` and `VS Code` are both appropriate choices when the workflow has strong support for project navigation, linting, formatting, Git, and integrated terminals. In VS Code, `ESLint`, `Prettier`, and `EditorConfig` are useful early defaults, with `GitLens` or remote-development tools added only when they clarify the workflow rather than distract from it."
				},
				{
					title: "macOS and Windows Walkthroughs",
					content:
						"On macOS, install Node.js LTS, the chosen editor, and verify that Node, npm, and a local dev server all run before moving into frameworks or deployment. On Windows, add early practice with path handling, terminals, and environment variables so hosting and backend topics do not feel like a second course with different rules."
				},
				{
					title: "Course Workspace and Folder Structure",
					content:
						"Create a workspace with folders for `html-css`, `javascript`, `full-stack`, and `deployment` so static front-end work can evolve into server-backed projects without losing organization. This structure also makes it concrete that front-end code, server code, deployment notes, and operational files often belong in related but distinct places."
				},
				{
					title: "Early Module on Browser Devtools, Git, npm, and Project Structure",
					content:
						"Before deeper framework or hosting topics appear, browser devtools, Git/GitHub basics, npm, and project layout need to become recurring strands. Deployment and back-end material feel connected when inspection, version control, and package management are normal development habits from the beginning."

					content:
						"Position this course as the bridge from browser-focused JavaScript to full web-development fluency. The current JavaScript courses are still valuable for programming, DOM work, and browser APIs, and now those skills connect to project structure, back-end services, databases, deployment, hosting, and operations."
				},
				{
					title: "Main Goals of the Expanded Path",
					content:
						"The expanded path has four main goals: turn browser-focused JavaScript into full web-development fluency, add practical hosting and deployment knowledge, connect front end, back end, databases, and networking, and prepare for publishing real projects rather than only local demos. These goals keep each new unit connected to the rest of the stack."
				},
				{
					title: "Suggested Course Family and Placement",
					content:
						"The broader family includes `JavaScript Level 1`, `JavaScript Level 2`, `Web Development Foundations`, `Full-Stack Web Apps`, and optionally `Deployment and Cloud Hosting`. This is the first place where those later directions become visible and where front-end practice starts growing into publishing and operations work."
				},
				{
					title: "Entry Expectations from JavaScript Level 1 and 2",
					content:
						"This course assumes comfort reading and writing small-to-medium JavaScript programs, working with HTML and CSS, manipulating the DOM, responding to events, and reasoning about APIs and basic data models. It can briefly reinforce those ideas without making review the center of the course. The real transition is from `browser-only projects` into `file-based local development, Git, npm, dev servers, back-end services, databases, and deployment`. Strong JavaScript Level 2 preparation may make the early setup material move quickly, but workflow and environment habits remain part of the curriculum rather than optional side topics."
				},
				{
					title: "What This Course Is Not",
					content:
						"The course is not only about memorizing frameworks or copying tutorial steps. It is about learning repeatable workflows, strong project boundaries, debugging discipline, and enough operational understanding to explain how a site is built, served, configured, and observed after launch."

				},
				{
					title: "Use More File-Based Local Projects, Not Only CodePen",

				},

					title: "Add Git and GitHub as Normal Workflow Tools",
