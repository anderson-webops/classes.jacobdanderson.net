						"Unsupervised learning takes a dataset without labels and tries to find patterns or groupings in it. Customer segmentation is a motivating example: a store owner can group customers by characteristics like age, income, or spending behavior to better target marketing. Clustering is the process of finding distinct groups (clusters) of similar data points. A simple 2D example uses points A(1,1), B(2,1), C(3,3), and D(4,3). After plotting them, {A,B} visually form one cluster and {C,D} form another. Algorithms become necessary when there are hundreds or thousands of points instead of just four."

					title: "K-Means Clustering Algorithm",

						"K-means clustering is a popular algorithm that partitions data into k clusters. A centroid is the mean of all points in a cluster, thought of as the cluster's center. Each point is assigned to the cluster whose centroid it is closest to, usually using Euclidean distance sqrt((y2 - y1)^2 + (x2 - x1)^2). In a four-point example using A, B, C, and D with k = 2, the steps are: choose k, pick initial centroids such as A and B, assign each point to the nearest centroid, recompute centroids by averaging point coordinates in each cluster, and repeat until centroids stop changing. One or two computed iterations make the distance calculations visible and show that results can depend on the initial random centroids."

					title: "ML1 Project 1: Customer Segmentation",
					content: `**Goal:** Build k-means clustering from scratch to group customers by annual income and spending score.

**Setup:**
- Create a dedicated Google Drive folder for machine-learning projects.
- Download or open the linked customer segmentation CSV from the course source repository.
- Mount Google Drive in Colab and read the CSV with pandas.
- Inspect the columns and select annual income plus spending score as the two clustering features.

**Exploration:**
- Create a scatterplot of income versus spending score before clustering.
- Estimate how many groups appear visually and record why that estimate might be uncertain.

**Algorithm steps:**
1. Choose \`k\`, such as \`k = 5\`.
2. Store the data points in a list or array.
3. Choose \`k\` random initial centroids.
4. Store current centroids, previous centroids, and each customer's assigned cluster index.
5. Repeat until the centroids stop changing:
   - Compute Euclidean distance from each point to each centroid.
   - Assign each point to the nearest centroid.
   - Copy current centroids to previous centroids with \`deepcopy\`.
   - Recompute each centroid by averaging all points assigned to that cluster.

**Checkpoints:**
- The final plot uses different colors for different clusters.
- The algorithm is run more than once so random initialization is visible.
- At least two \`k\` values are compared.
- The written summary explains the dataset, the clustering goal, the final groups, and one surprising or uncertain pattern.`,

Then trace the KNN algorithm: choose k, such as k = 2, compute Euclidean distance from E to each point, identify the k closest neighbors, and assign E to the cluster appearing most often among those neighbors. The distance table shows that E is closest to C and D, both in Cluster 2, so KNN classifies E as Cluster 2."

					content: `A neural network is another technique for classification and regression. The smallest useful unit is a neuron.

**Neuron model:**
- A neuron takes a fixed number of inputs and produces one output.
- Each input has a corresponding weight.
- The neuron also has a bias value.
- The weighted sum is passed through an activation function.

**Details:**
- If a neuron has two inputs, it needs two weights: \`w1\` and \`w2\`.
- The weighted input terms are \`x1*w1\` and \`x2*w2\`.
- The bias is added after the weighted terms: \`x1*w1 + x2*w2 + b\`.
- A sigmoid graph is useful here because the sigmoid function always returns a value between 0 and 1.
- Common activation functions include sigmoid and ReLU.

**Output formula:** \`y = f(x1*w1 + x2*w2 + b)\`

**Worked example:**
1. Let \`x1 = 0\`, \`x2 = 1\`, \`w1 = 1\`, \`w2 = 2\`, and \`b = 1\`.
2. Use sigmoid as the activation function.
3. Compute the weighted sum: \`(0)(1) + (1)(2) + 1 = 3\`.
4. Apply the activation function: \`f(3) = 0.953\` using a sigmoid calculator.

						"A neural network is a collection of neurons organized in layers. A typical structure includes an input layer that passes in feature values, one or more hidden layers where neurons compute intermediate representations, and an output layer that produces the final prediction. In a small network with two inputs, a hidden layer of two neurons, and a single output neuron, the inputs go into both hidden neurons; each hidden neuron computes its output; then the output neuron takes those two hidden outputs as inputs, applies its own weights and activation, and produces the final output. A worked numeric example makes the continuous result traceable instead of treating the network as a black box."

**Build steps:**
1. Initialize \`x1\`, \`x2\`, and \`b\`.
2. Create two \`Neuron\` objects for the hidden layer, each with its own weights and activation function.
3. Create a third \`Neuron\` object for the output layer.

					content: `Neural networks can be used for classification tasks.

**Feature connection:**
- Each feature becomes an input value in the input layer.
- During training, each feature vector is fed forward through the network.
- The network produces an output that is compared to the true label.

**Training idea:**
- A loss function measures how far the prediction is from the true label.
- Backpropagation computes how much each weight contributed to that error.
- The optimizer updates weights to reduce loss over many examples.
- Training is the search for weights and biases that generalize, not just weights that memorize the training set.

**Classification output:** Neural-network outputs are continuous, so classification needs a mapping from output values to categories. A binary classifier might round a value between 0 and 1, while a multi-class classifier often uses softmax.

**Tooling note:** Keras is a high-level library that handles many implementation details for building and training neural networks.`

				},
				{
					title: "Course Recap & Next Steps",
					content: `**Recap targets:**
- Unsupervised learning and clustering.
- Supervised learning and classification.
- KNN, Naive Bayes, neural networks, regression, overfitting, evaluation, and image classification.
- The difference between a working notebook and a justified modeling result.

**Master Project connection:**
- Identify which techniques were used.
- State what evidence supports the results.
- Name the strongest limitation that remains.
- Explain what would be improved with more time, data, or compute.

**Next-step options:** Strong follow-on paths include USACO training for advanced competitive programming, AP Computer Science, or language-specific Level 1 courses in Java, JavaScript, or C++.

**Portfolio framing:** Treat the Master Project as evidence of a complete data/modeling workflow, including data cleaning, model selection, evaluation, comparison, and cautious interpretation.`
