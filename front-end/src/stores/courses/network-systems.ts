					content:
						"## Follow a frame, a packet and a connection\n\nDraw the client, middle device and server before predicting an outcome. Mark each interface's IP prefix, MAC address and link. A single box can bridge frames, route IP packets, translate connection addresses and apply filtering rules. Those operations answer different questions. The Unit 3 apparatus supplies its configuration so the required work is to explain observations. Unit 7 later asks for forwarding and NAT command edits in NS6. Unit 12 continues that saved NS6 attempt with a restrictive exposure policy. Keep those later configuration tasks distinct from this introduction.\n\n### A bridge connects an Ethernet segment\n\nAn Ethernet frame carries source and destination MAC addresses. A bridge learns source MAC addresses on its ports and uses its forwarding database (FDB) when forwarding frames. A destination not yet learned can require flooding to eligible ports; an FDB entry is therefore a time-bound observation, not an inventory of every attached device. Link state and bridge port state also affect forwarding. The virtual bridge in this exercise has spanning tree disabled and no VLAN exercise. Its results do not demonstrate physical switch behavior, VLAN isolation or spanning-tree convergence.\n\nIn the first topology, client 10.31.0.2/24 and server 10.31.0.3/24 share a bridged link. The client treats the server prefix as on-link. IPv4 neighbor resolution associates an on-link next hop with a link-layer address. The bridge forwards Ethernet frames between its two ports even while the middle namespace's IP forwarding setting is zero. Match actual peer MAC addresses to the learned FDB ports. This is evidence about this bridge configuration; it is not a rule that all traffic through any bridge bypasses every filtering hook.\n\nPause and predict what happens when the server-facing bridge port goes down. Retain the failed request alongside the deliberately changed port state, then compare a fresh successful request after restoration. A timeout alone is ambiguous. The controlled change, actual state and restored result together support the explanation. Keep the original failed result rather than replacing it with the successful retry.\n\n### A router needs an outbound and return path\n\nIn the second topology, the server moves to 10.32.0.2/24 on another link. The middle interfaces are 10.31.0.1/24 and 10.32.0.1/24. Each endpoint has its adjacent middle address as a gateway. For an off-link destination, the client resolves its next hop's MAC address while retaining the remote server as the IP destination. A gateway is the next hop, not a claim that the whole Internet is reachable. The route lookup, selected interface and neighbor entries describe different parts of that decision.\n\nThe middle namespace must also permit IPv4 forwarding. With forwarding disabled, configured connected routes alone do not carry this request between the links. With forwarding enabled and appropriate endpoint return routes, the server receives a fresh request and sees the original client address. Basic routing here needs no address translation. In the optional transfer exercise, removing the client gateway prevents the outbound route; restoring it permits another request. Removing the server's default route then breaks the return direction. Compare both route lookups and each restoration before naming the failed boundary. These constructed failures do not establish that any unrelated timeout has the same cause.\n\n### Translation changes endpoint views\n\nSource NAT (SNAT) in this apparatus changes the source address seen at the server from the client address to the middle device's server-facing address. Preserve the client's numeric local and peer endpoints, the server's observed local and peer endpoints, the actual translation rule and the response token. The two endpoint views can differ while belonging to one observed exchange. Routing determines where packets go; translation changes selected address or port fields. Translation alone does not establish a restrictive policy or application authorization.\n\nThe optional mapping exercise adds destination NAT (DNAT). The client requests the middle device's client-facing address on mapped port 18080; the rule maps that destination to the server on service port 8080. Compare that request with the server's actual local endpoint. Connection tracking maintains translation state for the flow and corresponding replies. The experiment opens a fresh curl process and TCP connection for each case. Removing the mapping and testing a new connection demonstrates that new attempt's outcome. It does not prove that every existing connection immediately loses an earlier mapping. Retain the successful direct request after mapping removal as a separate comparison.\n\n### Boundaries, changed cases and completion\n\nRepeat with the alternate private prefixes and service/mapped ports shown in the guide. Predict the affected gateway, on-link destination and translated peer before reading the report. Match each run's unique token, owned listener PID and UID, raw HTTP result and namespace identities. Use the complete notebook to explain both expected and contrary results. Keep edge-cases.md labeled as supplied reasoning cases rather than actual public probes. Python summary programming is optional; collecting a report does not complete the explanation.\n\nA home network can have multiple translation layers, ISP restrictions and an upstream firewall. A port mapping on one router establishes none of those other conditions. A public server can have a directly routed address while still restricting traffic. IPv6 routing, neighbor discovery and policy require their own evidence; this private IPv4 experiment measures none of them. Confirm the worker was reaped, the owned listener disappeared, private namespaces and links were removed, and outer host configuration matched its initial snapshot. Save the original report with the notebook, including errors and remaining uncertainty.\n\nFor further detail, use the [Linux bridge documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/bridge.html), [route command reference](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ip-route.8.html) and [NAT target reference](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/iptables-extensions.8.html). The actual course guide defines this experiment's narrower scope."

An ICMP echo reply from `ping` establishes that this particular request and reply succeeded; it does not prove that a TCP service or application is ready. `traceroute` estimates a path from hop-limit responses, `tracepath` can expose path MTU clues, and `mtr` repeats observations over time. An intermediate router can limit diagnostic replies while continuing to forward application traffic, so an isolated missing hop or apparent per-hop loss is not enough to locate an application failure.

						"## Read an IPv6 path as separate evidence\n\nAn address, prefix, interface, route, neighbor entry, DNS answer, listening socket\nand application response describe different parts of a path. Diagnose IPv6\nusing its own observations before comparing it with IPv4. A successful IPv4\nrequest does not establish that any IPv6 step succeeds.\n\n### Address families, scope and prefixes\n\nIPv6 addresses contain 128 bits. The loopback address ::1 remains within the\ncurrent node and network namespace. A link-local address in fe80::/10 belongs\nto one link; retain the actual interface or zone when identifying a link-local\ndestination or next hop. The same numeric link-local value can exist on two\ndifferent links. A global-unicast address has a different scope, but its shape\nalone proves neither a usable route nor Internet application connectivity.\nThe 2001:db8::/32 examples in the supplied cases are documentation addresses.\n\nA prefix states how many leading bits select a numeric block. A /126 contains\nfour addresses, a /127 contains two and a /128 identifies one. IPv6 has no\nbroadcast address. Do not apply the ordinary IPv4 network/broadcast subtraction\nto every IPv6 prefix, or infer that every numeric member is an assignable\napplication endpoint. Keep calculation, interface assignment and observed\nservice behavior as separate claims.\n\n### Lookup, route and on-link delivery\n\nAn A answer contains IPv4 address data; an AAAA answer contains IPv6 address\ndata. A system NSS lookup can also use local hosts data and system policy.\nAn explicit server selected for a DNS query does not change that system lookup.\nRetain the question, record type, responding server, response status and time\nwhen comparing answers. A CNAME is an alias, a negative name answer differs\nfrom a transport failure, and answer order alone does not establish which\nfamily a later application actually used.\n\nRead the selected IPv6 route, source address and outgoing interface. For an\non-link destination or next hop, Neighbor Discovery provides relevant link-layer\nand reachability information. A FAILED neighbor entry can locate a problem\nbefore a TCP listener or application is reached. An empty passive table does\nnot establish a broken neighbor protocol. Loopback does not exercise on-link\nNeighbor Discovery. The actual loopback route to ::1 is evidence for this local\npath only; the supplied cases cover the separate on-link reasoning.\n\n### Router information, address configuration and next hops\n\nRouter Advertisements can carry prefix information and router information with\ndifferent meanings. An on-link indication, permission for autonomous address\nconfiguration and a nonzero router lifetime are separate facts. SLAAC can use\nadvertised information to form an address. DHCPv6 can provide addresses or\nother configuration. A DHCPv6 lease by itself does not establish the chosen\ndefault router, source address or working application path. Compare actual\naddress state and the selected route instead of guessing from a configuration\nmechanism's name. The owned loopback program does not send or capture Router\nAdvertisements or DHCPv6 exchanges.\n\n### Listener family, policy and application response\n\nA TCP endpoint includes its family, bound address and port. Two sockets can\nshare one numeric port while belonging to different address families. The\nproject sets IPV6_V6ONLY=1 on its ::1 listener. In paired mode a distinct\n127.0.0.1 socket supplies IPv4 service. That result does not demonstrate one\nwildcard dual-stack socket, mapped IPv4 addresses or automatic client family\nselection. Match the actual PID, UID, address, port and per-run response token.\n\nInspect policy for the relevant family and path. A rule shown for IPv4 alone\nis insufficient evidence about IPv6; some shared rulesets handle both families,\nso retain the actual rule, family conditions, chain and match evidence. A live\nlistener does not prove policy allowance. A packet counter establishes matching\npackets, while an HTTP response separately establishes an application exchange.\nA real timeout needs further evidence before it is attributed to a firewall.\n\n### Predict, observe and explain\n\nUse the complete core guide and its five imported files. Predict IPv4 refusal\nand IPv6 success in v6-only mode, then compare the two owned responses in paired\nmode. Retain raw commands, listener ownership, request/response records and\nworker cleanup. Keep the actual neighbor snapshot separate from a claim about\nan actively measured neighbor exchange.\n\nComplete supplied Cases A, B and C as explicitly labeled constructed reasoning exercises.\nTrace the first unsupported boundary in each family, compare intended and\nactual address assignment, and name the next authorized observation needed to\ntest the diagnosis. Reuse the earlier DNS/NSS observations with their scope\nintact. No host configuration or firewall change is required for this project.\n\nFor independent review, make predictions before reading the next observation\nand preserve unexpected results. In a guided walkthrough, pause at scope,\nlookup, selected route, neighbor where relevant, listener, policy, application\nresponse and cleanup. The operations notebook continues this same required\nattempt. Prefix transfer and paired-service extension projects remain optional;\nPython analysis is supplemental practice rather than a prerequisite for the\nnetworking explanation."

						"## Identify the application boundary before choosing a correction\n\nA route, connection, protocol reply, trusted peer and completed operation are\ndifferent observations. Record the issuing host and namespace, intended\nservice, numeric destination and current time. Keep the requested hostname or\nauthority separately. Conventional port numbers are useful clues; they do not\nestablish which program answered or whether the intended operation succeeded.\nUse the actual protocol version and endpoint records when comparing results.\n\n### HTTP messages and representations\n\nAn HTTP request names a method and target and can carry fields and content.\nThe response carries a status, fields and sometimes a representation. GET\nretrieves a representation; HEAD supplies corresponding metadata without\ntransferring its content. A positive Content-Length on HEAD describes the\nrepresentation rather than a body that arrived. Content-Type describes the\nrepresentation format, while byte length and exact bytes remain separate facts.\nRetain binary content without replacing undecodable octets with text placeholders.\n\nThe required local project observes HTTP/1.1 directly. Its raw client reads each\nclosed connection through EOF and retains request and response bytes. A 404\nlocates a missing resource in that service's request handling; a 405 includes\nthe methods it permits. A planned 503 is a received application decision. The\nheld-port refusal has no HTTP response to classify. Distinguish a client\nprogram's exit status from the status inside a received protocol message.\n\nThe transfer project adds a matching validator, a stale validator and an\nexplicit redirect comparison. Keep a retained representation beside a 304\nresponse; the empty response is not a replacement body. Follow the separate\nLocation and destination exchanges rather than silently merging them. These\nrecords do not install a browser cache or measure a cache freshness lifetime.\nIn the extension project, an altered Host field changes an application request\nwhile the numeric loopback connection stays the same. That local behavior\ndoes not establish another server's virtual-host or authorization policy.\n\n### DNS and application reachability\n\nDNS questions and answers have their own protocol status and record types.\nAn A or AAAA answer supplies address data. An MX answer names a mail exchanger;\nthat name still needs usable address and application-path evidence. A negative\nname answer differs from a query with no received DNS response. Keep the\nselected resolver, question, type, status and time. System NSS lookup may use\nlocal data and policy that differ from an explicit DNS query. Use the earlier\nresolution exercise for actual DNS/NSS comparisons. Neither an answer nor an\nanswer's position proves that a later application used that address successfully.\n\n### HTTPS, TLS identity and visibility\n\nHTTPS protects HTTP with TLS. Separate the negotiated TLS connection, verification\nof the intended peer and the later HTTP operation. A trust-chain or name error\ncan stop a client before any HTTP status arrives. A trusted TLS connection can\nstill return an HTTP authentication or application error. Inspect the authorized\nclient's verification result before describing the operation as successful.\n\nPassive visibility depends on protocol version and observation position.\nFor TLS 1.3, handshake messages after ServerHello are encrypted, including the\nserver's certificate message. A passive capture without the relevant secrets\ndoes not expose that certificate or HTTP content merely because a connection\nis visible. IP addresses, transport endpoints, sizes and timing can still be\nobserved at the capture point. Preserve the negotiated version and distinguish\nclient diagnostic output from information visible to an unrelated observer.\nDo not assume that a hostname field is always visible or that TLS authenticates\nan application account. The current HTTP program establishes no TLS session.\n\n### SSH host identity and account authorization\n\nSSH also has several boundaries: reaching a server, verifying its host identity,\nauthenticating an account and completing an authorized operation. A changed\nhost-key warning is not the same evidence as an account key being rejected.\nA working SSH session and a failing web request can narrow a comparison only\nwhen their hosts, addresses, ports, policies and issuing contexts are retained.\nThey are different services and can follow different paths. Verify the expected\nhost identity through an independent trusted channel before changing remembered\nkeys. Do not disable verification to manufacture a successful diagnostic result.\n\n### SMTP submission, relay and delivery evidence\n\nSMTP transfers mail using commands and replies. Submission accepts outgoing\nmessages from an authorized client; relay transfers messages between mail\nsystems. Envelope sender and recipient commands have a different role from\nthe message's displayed From and To headers. Preserve that distinction when\nexplaining routing or an authorization failure.\n\nAn SMTP dialogue can include a greeting, EHLO capabilities, MAIL FROM, RCPT TO\nand DATA. The end of DATA is followed by the receiving server's decision about\naccepting that message. A positive completion reply at that point establishes\nacceptance by that server, rather than final inbox placement or human reading.\nRetain the queue identifier and issuing server if later delivery is investigated.\nTemporary 4xx and permanent 5xx replies call for different policy decisions;\nthe exact command and enhanced diagnostic text matter to the interpretation.\n\nTLS may begin immediately for implicit-TLS submission, conventionally port 465,\nor be negotiated through STARTTLS on a submission connection, commonly port 587.\nKeep configured TLS requirements, peer verification and account authentication\nseparate. A TCP connection or an advertised capability alone proves none of\nthose completed steps. This course project sends no mail and opens no SMTP\nconnection. Use supplied records for this comparison rather than contacting\nan unrelated mail server.\n\n### Independent diagnosis and paced review\n\nFor each protocol, record the last supported boundary, the observed result,\nplausible alternatives and the next authorized observation that could distinguish\nthem. Predict before opening each result. In a paced walkthrough, pause at\nlookup, connection, peer identity and application response before proceeding.\nKeep actual HTTP records separate from the constructed DNS/TLS/SSH cases.\nComplete the core notebook in the same saved attempt; optional transfer and\nextension tasks have their own goals and saved work. Python summaries are\noptional. A successful run does not establish completion of the explanations.\n\nProtocol references: [HTTP semantics, RFC 9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html),\n[TLS 1.3, RFC 8446](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446.html),\n[SMTP, RFC 5321](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5321.html) and\n[mail submission TLS, RFC 8314](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8314.html)."
