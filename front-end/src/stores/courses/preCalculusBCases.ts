			"**Exact values from triangles.** Splitting an equilateral triangle of side 2 produces a 30-60-90 triangle with sides `1, sqrt(3), 2`. Thus `sin(30 degrees) = 1/2` and `cos(30 degrees) = sqrt(3)/2`. A right triangle with legs 1 has hypotenuse `sqrt(2)`, giving sine and cosine `sqrt(2)/2` at 45 degrees. On the unit circle these are the y- and x-coordinates.\n\nFor 150 degrees, the reference angle is 30 degrees and the point is in quadrant II: `(-sqrt(3)/2, 1/2)`. Therefore `tan(150 degrees) = -sqrt(3)/3`. Convert using `180 degrees = pi radians`; adding `2pi` radians preserves the point. Reciprocal ratios are `sec = 1/cos`, `csc = 1/sin`, and `cot = cos/sin`, wherever the denominators are nonzero.\n\n**Triangle laws.** Sides a, b, c are opposite angles A, B, C. The law of sines is `a/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C)`. The law of cosines is `a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc cos(A)`. With `b = 5, c = 7, A = 60 degrees`, the included-angle calculation gives `a^2 = 25 + 49 - 70(1/2) = 39`, so `a = sqrt(39)`.\n\nFor the side-side-angle data `A = 30 degrees, a = 5, b = 8`, the sine law gives `sin(B) = 4/5`. Both `B approx 53.130 degrees` and `B approx 126.870 degrees` leave a positive third angle, so there are two triangles. Their third angles are approximately 96.870 and 23.130 degrees; their third sides are `3 + 4sqrt(3)` and `4sqrt(3) - 3`. Always test the supplementary angle instead of accepting just the calculator's first answer.",

A negative A reflects the graph across its midline.\n\nFor `f(x) = 2sin[(pi/2)(x - 1)] + 3`, the amplitude is 2, period 4, midline 3, and shift 1 to the right. Divide the period into quarters: x values `1, 2, 3, 4, 5` give y values `3, 5, 3, 1, 3`. Plot these points and repeat the pattern; the range is `[1, 5]`.",

A height model is `h(t) = 1.5cos(pi t/6) + 2` meters, where t is hours and `0 <= t <= 12`. Find the period, maximum and minimum heights and their times, and the height at t = 3.

Between `-pi/4` and `pi/4`, the points `(-pi/8, -1), (0, 0), (pi/8, 1)` anchor an increasing branch.\n\nReciprocal graphs use division, not inverse functions: `sec = 1/cos`, `csc = 1/sin`, and `cot = cos/sin`. Zeros in the relevant denominator create exclusions and asymptotes. A secant or cosecant output cannot lie strictly between -1 and 1.\n\nInverse functions restrict the original trig function to one-to-one intervals. The principal ranges are `[-pi/2, pi/2]` for arcsin, `[0, pi]` for arccos, and `(-pi/2, pi/2)` for arctan. Their domains are `[-1, 1]`, `[-1, 1]`, and all reals, respectively.",

For example, `(1 - cos^2(x))/sin(x) = sin^2(x)/sin(x) = sin(x)` requires `sin(x) != 0`; cancellation does not restore excluded angles.\n\nAngle formulas are `sin(a +/- b) = sin(a)cos(b) +/- cos(a)sin(b)` and `cos(a +/- b) = cos(a)cos(b) -/+ sin(a)sin(b)`. Also `sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x)` and `cos(2x) = 1 - 2sin^2(x) = 2cos^2(x) - 1`. The tangent sum formula is `(tan(a) + tan(b))/(1 - tan(a)tan(b))` wherever the original tangents and final denominator are defined.\n\nHalf-angle formulas use `sin(x/2) = +/-sqrt[(1 - cos(x))/2]` and `cos(x/2) = +/-sqrt[(1 + cos(x))/2]`; choose signs from the quadrant of x/2. To solve `2sin(x) = 1` on `[0, 2pi)`, use the reference angle pi/6 and the positive-sine quadrants: `x = pi/6, 5pi/6`.",
