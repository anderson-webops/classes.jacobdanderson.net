Range is maximum minus minimum. A mode has the greatest frequency; report tied modes when some values repeat, and no mode when every value occurs once. These lessons use the median-of-halves quartile convention: omit the overall median when n is odd, then take the median of each half as Q1 and Q3. The interquartile range is IQR=Q3-Q1. Different quartile conventions can give different results, so state the convention. Counts in a frequency table weight each value by how often it occurs.",

Replacing 14 with 44 raises the mean to 12 and range to 42 but leaves the median 4; the unusually large value affects these summaries differently.",
