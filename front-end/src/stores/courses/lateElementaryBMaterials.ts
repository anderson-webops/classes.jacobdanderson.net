				prompt: "Use a paper simulation of two fixed circular tracks centered at (0,0), with π = 3.14 and 98000000 miles per classroom AU. Tesla starts at (2,0), radius 2 AU, at 60000 mph. TR9000 may choose radius 0.5–3 AU and begins on its negative x-axis at 60000 mph; adjust speed in 150-mph increments. Explain why an intercept requires radius 2. Choose 2 and add one increment. The initial gap is half a circumference. Calculate catch time = gap/(60150 - 60000). At one quarter, one half, three quarters and all of that time, tabulate the fraction of the original gap closed. Find both positions at catch time from completed lap counts.",

Separately compare a fictional Earth track at r = 1 and 60000 mph with a fictional Mars track at r = 1.6 and the given 50000 mph; these comparison speeds are separate supplied inputs. Find each period in days and explain which comparisons follow the trial rule.",
