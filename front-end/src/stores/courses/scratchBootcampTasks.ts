On the green flag, show the elephant, restore size 100 and clear graphic effects so a new run starts predictably.`

1. Make a Clicks variable and reset it to 0 at the start.

3. Make a Seconds left variable and start it at 10.
4. Before counting down, show the button and say "Ready...", "Set..." and "Go!" for 1 second each. Keep scoring inactive during this introduction.
5. Enable scoring, then repeat 10 times: wait 1 second and reduce Seconds left by 1.
6. At 0, disable scoring and hide the button. A new green-flag start shows Regular and resets both counters.
A Playing variable with values 0 and 1 can guard the existing click stack, as shown in the lesson.`

1. On the green flag, reset Score to 0 and make Shark 2 follow the mouse pointer continuously.
2. While the mouse button is pressed, switch the shark to its closed-mouth costume and play its supplied Bite sound. Restore its resting costume when the button is released.
3. Make Fish and Fish2 move to random positions, wait 2 seconds and repeat.
4. A catch needs both conditions: the mouse button is down and that fish is touching Shark 2.
5. For a caught ordinary fish, add 1 to Score, play the fish's bubbles sound and move it away immediately. One contact must not score repeatedly.
6. Give each pufferfish similar movement and collision code, but subtract 1 when it is caught.
7. Optional: add a timed round, disable scoring at the end and report the final score.
Restart with score, positions and costumes reset. The fish scripts belong to the fish sprites; the supplied sound is Bite rather than a separate whoosh clip.`

4. Create Lives and reset it to 3 on the green flag.
5. A Dragon contact subtracts exactly 1 life before that Dragon respawns away from Princess. Reaching the lower boundary alone does not cost a life. End play when Lives reaches 0.
6. Reset Timer to 60, reduce it once per second and end the round at 0. The finished state stops movement and further life changes.
A new green-flag run restores all actors, Lives and Timer. The saved variable values in the empty starter do not implement these reset or countdown scripts.`
