1. Start by playing the sample Hungry Hippo game and identifying the player sprite, collectable objects, score, and timer.
2. Create a custom version with a sprite of your choice.
3. Program arrow-key movement with direction and movement blocks.
4. Add collectable objects that disappear or reset when the player sprite touches them.
5. Create a score variable that increases when an object is collected.
6. Create a timer variable that decreases as the game runs.

**Completion check:** The player moves in four directions, collects objects, gains points, and has a visible countdown that changes during play.`,

Typing practice is not required to complete the Scratch course, but it can make the move to text-based programming smoother. Choose games that feel useful, practice for about 15 to 20 minutes as needed, and move to the intermediate options if the beginner games feel too easy.

**Why it matters:** Scratch programs are assembled from blocks, while Python programs are typed. Keyboard fluency reduces friction so more attention can go toward variables, loops, conditionals, and debugging.
