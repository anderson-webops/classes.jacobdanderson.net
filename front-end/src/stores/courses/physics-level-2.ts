The modeling workflow includes VS Code or PyCharm for optional Python notebooks, spreadsheets for quick data work, and browser tools like PhET and Desmos for visual reasoning. The course now expects more multi-step modeling, clearer assumptions, and stronger graph interpretation than the introductory sequence."

				{
					title: "Functions, Vectors, and Coordinate Systems",
					content:
						"Treat position, velocity, and acceleration as functions that can be analyzed numerically, graphically, and geometrically. Reinforce vector direction, magnitude, and components, then explain how a well-chosen coordinate system can simplify a complicated problem dramatically. Build the habit of choosing axes before writing equations."

				},
				{
					title: "Graph and Data Exercise: Motion Graph Detective 2D",
					content:
						"Extend the motion-graph strand by combining graph interpretation with vector reasoning. Compare horizontal and vertical component graphs, estimate turning points, and decide when acceleration changes only one part of the motion. Justify each conclusion with slope, area, or vector language."
				},
				{
					title: "Investigation or Simulation: Ballistics Model Comparison",

			title: "PHY9 Multi-Force Systems and Equilibrium",
			curriculum: [
				{
					title: "Net Force in Real Systems",
					content:
						"Forces are vectors that can combine, oppose, or redirect motion, so the course moves beyond single-force examples. Equilibrium, acceleration, and isolating one object at a time matter in multi-object systems. Free-body diagrams stay central instead of becoming a warm-up step."

			curriculum: [
				{
					title: "Momentum as a Conserved Quantity",
					content:

				},
				{
					title: "Worked Example Set: Recoil, Bounces, and Crash Carts",

					content:
						"Mechanics extends from straight-line motion to rotation through angular displacement, angular velocity, angular acceleration, and torque. Levers, doors, wrenches, and balance points make the ideas physical before formalizing them. Where a force acts matters just as much as how large it is."
				},
				{
					title: "Worked Example Set: Lever Arms and Rotational Equilibrium",
					content:
						"Work several torque-balance problems involving seesaws, meter sticks, hanging masses, and tools. Compare a force applied close to the pivot with the same force applied farther away, and explain the difference with moment arm language. Use sign conventions carefully so rotational direction becomes part of the reasoning."
				},

				{
					title: "Investigation or Simulation: Balance and Door-Handle Analysis",
					content:
						"Use a balance simulation, provided torque dataset, door-handle case, or optional safe physical observation to compare rotational effectiveness at different distances from the pivot. Connect physical effort to torque rather than claiming one side is simply 'heavier' in every case."
				},
				{
					title: "Reflection Question: How Is Rotation Like Translation, and How Is It Different?",
					content:

This module functions as a bridge from terrestrial mechanics to space applications."
				},
				{
					title: "Worked Example Set: Loops, Satellites, and Orbital Speed",
					content:
						"Work a loop-the-loop force comparison, a satellite-in-orbit speed problem, and a mass-distance gravity comparison.

Review current, voltage, and resistance, then extend to equivalent resistance, junction reasoning, and how potential difference drives charge motion. Keep the physics grounded in practical circuits while showing the deeper conceptual layer behind them."
				},
				{
					title: "Worked Example Set: Series-Parallel Analysis and Potential Drops",
					content:

The module then bridges to optics and early modern-physics ideas by showing how models can shift when wave behavior, energy quantization, or light-matter interaction becomes important. This is intentionally a bridge module: it broadens the physics map without requiring a full advanced course in each topic."
				},
				{
					title: "Worked Example Set: Heating Curves, Lenses, and Threshold Ideas",
					content:
						"Work one heat-transfer comparison, one heating-curve interpretation, and one simple mirror or lens reasoning problem. Close with a modern-physics bridge discussion such as why light color alone can matter in photoelectric-style threshold reasoning, even when brightness changes too. Keep the emphasis on interpretation and model choice rather than advanced derivations."

						"Start each simulation by naming the system, stored quantities, update equation, units, and stopping condition.

						"Fluid models treat many particles as a continuous material when the scale makes that approximation useful. Pressure, density, viscosity, flow rate, and boundary shape determine which model is reasonable. The important habit is naming when a continuum model is useful and when turbulence, compressibility, or material complexity makes it too simple."

						"Define the fluid region, inlet and outlet conditions, pressure or height difference, flow assumptions, and relevant material properties. Use diagrams to show where pressure changes, where speed changes, and where energy or mass conservation is being applied. Keep units visible because flow, pressure, and density errors often hide inside conversions."
