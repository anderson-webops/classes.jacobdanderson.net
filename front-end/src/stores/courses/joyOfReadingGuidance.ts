		module: "JoR1 Characters",
		method: "A character is a person, animal or other being in a story. An appearance detail describes how a character looks, such as coat color or height; a trait describes a pattern such as patience or generosity. An inference is an idea drawn from clues rather than a direct statement. An action or spoken line can support an inference about a trait. Explain how the detail supports the inference instead of merely copying it. A single action supports a claim about that moment; it may not establish an unchanging personality. The named story texts are not included; those assignments require a separate copy.",
		worked: "Practice passage: Nia wore a green coat. When Ari dropped the seed packets, Nia gathered them and sorted each label. She stayed after the others left to finish. Green coat is an appearance detail. Helpful is supported by gathering Ari’s packets; patient is supported by staying to sort them. A three-sentence report can name Nia, explain one action and infer its effect: Nia helps Ari after the spill. Sorting the labels shows care. Without that action, the group might plant seeds in the wrong places.",

Eli pinned one corner of each card, checked the labels and tried a second pin when the first failed. Jo said, Thank you for staying. Separate one appearance detail from two action details. Infer a trait and explain its evidence in three sentences.",

		module: "JoR2 Plot",
		method: "Plot is the connected sequence of events around a problem. Exposition introduces the characters and setting. Rising action develops the problem through attempts or complications. The climax is the decisive turning point. Falling action shows its immediate results, and resolution shows the situation after the main problem is settled. Explain the event’s function when assigning a label. A loud event is not automatically the climax.",
		worked: "Practice story: Sam prepares a paper-boat race beside a shallow tub. The first boat tips over. Sam folds a wider base and tests it. The next launch stays upright and reaches the far edge. Sam uses that design for the race. Exposition: race preparation. Rising action: the failed launch and revised fold. Climax: the successful test resolves whether the new design works. Falling action: the boat reaches the edge. Resolution: Sam selects the tested design. The turning point matters because it changes the plan from uncertain to usable.",

Water beads on the new letters without washing them away. The class paints the full sign and hangs it. Name the problem and place the events into exposition, rising action, climax, falling action and resolution. One event may serve two neighboring functions when the reason is clear.",

		module: "JoR Check-In #1",
		method: "A combined reading response connects a character’s action to a plot change. Identify the problem, find the action that changes it, and distinguish an inferred trait from an explicit detail. A labeled drawing, oral explanation or short paragraph can carry the same evidence. A prediction must be labeled as an inference rather than described as an event that already happened.",
		worked: "Practice story: Asha and Ben have one dry sheet for a poster. Ben reaches for dark paint, but Asha first tests it on a small corner. The color spreads too far, so they choose a pencil outline and finish a readable poster. Asha’s test supports cautious or thoughtful. The spreading paint is a complication; choosing the outline is the turning point. A prediction that a second poster may use pencil is plausible, but the story does not say that a second poster is made.",

		module: "JoR3 Reading Literature",
		method: "A summary selects the events needed to understand the main problem and outcome. A storyboard arranges those events in sequence; each panel includes a caption explaining its place in the story. A theme or lesson is an idea supported by the events, not merely a topic such as friendship. Different lessons can be defensible when the evidence explains them. Keep an opinion about the story separate from what the story actually states.",
		worked: "Practice story: Rae volunteers to deliver a class display. She puts every object into one thin bag. The handle tears. Rae asks Kit for a box, sorts heavy objects underneath light ones and makes a second trip. The display arrives intact. Six useful panels show volunteering, overpacking, the tear, asking for a box, careful repacking and safe arrival. A supported lesson is that asking for help and changing a plan can solve a problem; the box and successful second trip provide evidence.",

		module: "JoR4 Reading Informational Texts",
		method: "An informational text explains a subject using stated details. The central idea tells what those details mainly explain; the topic alone is too broad. Who, what, when, where, why and how are useful questions, but a text may leave some unanswered. Mark missing information rather than inventing it. Distinguish a recorded observation from an interpretation. A news script can introduce the main idea, report selected details and finish by explaining their significance.",
		worked: "Invented practice notice: On Tuesday, the Hill School garden group placed three labeled rain gauges in its courtyard. The group will record water depth after each rain to compare the three locations. The notice’s central idea is that the group is preparing a location comparison. Who: the garden group. What: three gauges. When: Tuesday. Where: courtyard. Why: compare recorded depths. The notice does not give a calendar date or claim which location will collect the most water.",

		module: "JoR5 Figurative Language",
		method: "Literal meaning uses the words in their ordinary direct sense. Figurative language makes a comparison or uses an expression whose intended meaning differs from the literal picture. A simile makes an explicit comparison, often with like or as. A metaphor describes one thing as another. An idiom has a common meaning that cannot be recovered by interpreting each word literally. Personification gives a nonhuman thing a human action or quality. Categories can overlap, and context controls the interpretation.",
		worked: "In The test was a breeze, the test is compared to an easy light wind: the intended meaning is that it was easy. This can be described as a metaphor and an idiomatic expression. In The kettle sang a cheerful song, the kettle is given a human musical action, so personification is supported. Forceful movement alone, such as wind whipping through hair, does not necessarily give the wind a human action.",
		practice: {
			title: "Figurative Meaning Practice",
			prompt: "For each complete sentence, name the intended meaning and a supported language type: The kitten was as quiet as a shadow. After two failures, the puzzle was a hard nut to crack.

		module: "JoR Check-In #2",
		method: "A literature review combines a brief summary, a supported interpretation and an opinion with reasons. An informational response identifies a central idea and explains how selected details support it. When discussing figurative language, quote or identify the actual phrase, explain the intended meaning and give a reason for the label. An imagined interview answer remains an imagined answer even when it is consistent with source facts.",
		worked: "Practice story: Leon calls his bent model a lost cause. He is as quiet as a mouse until Ana brings a brace. The model stands, and Leon thanks her. A review can summarize the repair and infer that help changes Leon’s outlook. Lost cause is an idiom for something considered hopeless; as quiet as a mouse is a simile. Claiming three examples when only two are supplied would invent evidence.",

A plan names the selected text, its summary or central idea, three evidence details and the audience. Completion includes the finished response and one revision supported by an evidence check. For literature, connect interpretation and opinion to events. For information, keep facts, uncertainty and imagined interview answers distinct.",
		worked: "Practice passage: Rin notices that the class map has no route labels. Rin adds arrows and asks two classmates to follow them. Both reach the garden. Rin changes one faint arrow after their feedback. A compact review can summarize the labeling and test, infer that Rin is responsive to feedback, and cite the arrows, the trial and the revised mark. An opinion such as The test makes the ending convincing is supported by the classmates actually following the route.",
