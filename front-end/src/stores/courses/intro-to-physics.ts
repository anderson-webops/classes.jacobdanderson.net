		{
			title: "PHY1 Measurement, Uncertainty, and Scientific Modeling",
			curriculum: [
				{
					title: "Introductions and Setup",
					content:
						"The opening workflow is intentionally lightweight and remote-friendly. Browser tools such as PhET, Desmos, spreadsheets, public videos, and provided datasets carry most of the course, while VS Code or PyCharm can be added later only when Python modeling is useful. A single physics folder for notes, exported graphs, annotated screenshots, and short simulation writeups keeps evidence organized without requiring hardware kits, physical sensors, special lab supplies, or a large software setup."
				},
				{
					title: "Measurement, Units, and Significant Figures",
					content:
						"Physics is the practice of building models from measurements, not just memorizing formulas. SI units, prefixes, unit conversions, significant figures, and the difference between precision and accuracy create the measurement foundation. Uncertainty is part of honest scientific communication: every distance, time, and mass measurement has a useful range, not a magical exact value."
				},
				{
					title: "Worked Example Set: Estimation and Uncertainty",
					content:
						"Short examples convert units, compare measured values, and round answers to appropriate precision. Include one estimate-first problem, such as predicting walking speed from a provided hallway dataset or short motion clip, so the value of a rough model is concrete without requiring a live experiment. Connect the examples to engineering habits: track assumptions, record units every line, and explain where the largest uncertainty comes from."
				},
				{
					title: "Graph and Data Exercise: Walking Trial Table",
					content:
						"Provided position-versus-time data from walking at different speeds is the default evidence source. Optional safe observations can be added if they are simple and appropriate, but the assignment works fully from the shared table. Build a data table, choose axes carefully, graph the results, and interpret the slope as speed. This is the first full data-analysis strand: table to graph, graph to meaning, and meaning back to the original motion."
				},
				{
					title: "Remote Investigation: Reaction-Time Data",
					content:
						"Use a provided ruler-drop dataset, simulation, or short demonstration video to connect measurement with uncertainty and repeated trials. Predict how reaction time is inferred from distance fallen, compute an average across several trials, and discuss why repeated measurements matter more than one lucky attempt. The key work is the reasoning chain from distance to time, not physically dropping an object. Close by identifying controllable variables, uncontrolled factors, and sources of experimental error."
				},
				{
					title: "Reflection Question: What Makes Evidence Trustworthy?",
					content:
						"Explain when a small dataset is still useful, when more trials are needed, and how a graph can strengthen or weaken an argument. Include a short reflection that distinguishes between a bad experiment, a noisy experiment, and a careful experiment with honest uncertainty."
				}
			],
			supplementalProjects: [
				{
					title: "Diagnostic Checkpoint",
					content:
						"Readiness check: convert units without losing meaning, label graphs with quantities and units, and explain why the same measured value can be both precise and inaccurate. Prompt: 'If two groups got slightly different walking speeds, does that automatically mean one group is wrong?'"
				},
				{
					title: "Failure Modes",
					content:
						"Common failure modes include treating a graph as a picture of the path rather than a relationship between variables, assuming more decimal places always mean better science, and treating uncertainty as failed experimentation."
				},
				{
					title: "Extension Project: Measurement Scavenger Hunt",
					content:
						"Choose ten everyday objects, images, diagrams, or motion scenarios and decide which quantities could be measured directly and which would need to be calculated. Record the likely tool or data source, the likely uncertainty, and one reason each measurement might be difficult. Physical measuring is optional; screenshots, public images, class diagrams, and provided data are acceptable evidence sources when they make the measurement reasoning visible."
				}

		},
		{
			title: "PHY2 Motion Graphs and Kinematics",
			curriculum: [
				{
					title: "Position, Velocity, and Acceleration",
					content:
						"Treat kinematics as the language of motion and make motion graphs a full strand rather than a quick side topic. Differentiate distance from displacement, speed from velocity, and velocity from acceleration, and use multiple examples where direction changes the interpretation. Connect verbal descriptions, diagrams, graphs, and equations as four views of the same physical story."
				},
				{
					title: "Worked Example Set: Reading Motion Stories",
					content:
						"Short scenarios such as a track sprinter, a marathon runner, and a tossed ball support translation between a story and a position-time or velocity-time graph. Include objects speeding up, slowing down, stopping, reversing direction, or moving at constant velocity. Slope and area reasoning matter more than formula memorization alone."
				},
				{
					title: "Graph and Data Exercise: Motion Graph Detective",
					content:
						"Several provided graphs support reconstructing what the object was doing during each interval. Then reverse the task: use a written story to sketch a graph that matches it. Include one graph with a common trap, such as a flat line on a position graph, and explain why it means 'stopped' rather than 'at zero speed forever.' The exercise works from shared graphs, diagrams, or simulations, so no live motion capture is required."
				},
				{
					title: "Remote Investigation: Motion Analysis",
					content:
						"Use a provided video clip, simulation export, or sample frame-by-frame table to analyze a rolling cart, bouncing ball, or walking person. Optional phone-camera data can be substituted when safe and convenient, but the required work is table-building, interval velocity estimation, and comparison between the graph and the original motion. The investigation bridges intuition and mathematics by showing that graphs come from measured or modeled evidence, not just textbook drawings."
				},
				{
					title: "Simulation Challenge: Bouncy Ball Toss and Air Traffic Control",
					content:
						"Use one qualitative toss scenario and one wind-plus-plane scenario to compare one-dimensional motion with combined motion. Predict outcomes first, then test them with simulation, diagramming, or provided data, and explain which part of the motion changes because of the extra velocity contribution."
				},
				{
					title: "Reflection Question: Which Representation Helped Most?",
					content:
						"Explain whether a diagram, graph, table, or equation was most helpful for one motion problem and why. Name one place where the conclusion changed after converting the same motion into a different representation."
				}
			],
			supplementalProjects: [
				{
					title: "Diagnostic Checkpoint",

						"Readiness check: move fluently between story, graph, and equation without being coached toward a specific formula. Prompt: explain the sign of velocity and acceleration in words, not just symbols."
				},
				{
					title: "Failure Modes",
					content:
						"Common failure modes include treating the steepest graph point as the object's highest physical position, interpreting a time-axis crossing as the object disappearing, and confusing negative velocity with negative speed."
				},
				{
					title: "Extension Project: Track Star vs. Marathon Runner",
					content:
						"Compare two runners with different strategies by building distance-time and velocity-time graphs for each. Defend which runner is more efficient for a sprint versus an endurance event, and use graph evidence rather than only intuition."
				}
			]
		},
		{
			title: "PHY3 Forces, Free-Body Diagrams, and Newton's Laws",
			curriculum: [
				{
					title: "Forces as Interactions",
					content:
						"Force is an interaction between objects rather than a vague push that automatically causes motion. Newton's laws depend on repeated free-body diagram practice, especially balanced versus unbalanced situations. Weight, normal force, tension, applied force, and friction remain distinct so later engineering problems stay organized."
				},
				{
					title: "Worked Example Set: Free-Body Diagram Repetition",
					content:
						"Work through a hanging object, a crate on a floor, an elevator rider, and a tug-of-war setup using diagrams or provided scenario cards. For each example, isolate one object at a time, label every external force, and connect the net force to the motion. Build repetition on purpose so the diagramming habit feels routine before the math gets harder."
				},
				{
					title: "Graph and Data Exercise: Net Force and Acceleration",
					content:
						"Use a small data table or simulation output showing how acceleration changes as net force changes for the same mass. Graph acceleration versus net force and interpret the trend in plain language. Then repeat with a larger mass so the slope comparison reveals what inertia changes."
				},
				{
					title: "Remote Investigation: Structure Force Analysis",
					content:
						"Use a provided bridge/tower diagram, photo set, simulation, or simple paper-design sketch to analyze compression, tension, and likely failure points. Physical construction is optional; the required artifact is a labeled model that explains why one design handles forces better than another. Sketches and force arrows connect structure to evidence rather than treating the challenge as trial and error. This is the module's main engineering tie-in."
				},
				{
					title: "Simulation Challenge: Runaway Train and Elevator Forces",
					content:
						"Analyze a runaway-train stopping scenario qualitatively, then revisit the elevator problem with scale readings and apparent weight. Use both scenarios to reinforce that the same Newtonian ideas explain very different systems when the forces are identified clearly."
				},
				{
					title: "Reflection Question: When Does 'No Motion' Still Mean Forces Matter?",
					content:
						"Explain why a motionless object can still be a rich force-analysis problem. Include an answer that mentions balanced forces, not the incorrect claim that 'there are no forces because nothing is moving.'"
				}
			],
			supplementalProjects: [
				{
					title: "Diagnostic Checkpoint",
					content:
						"Use quick diagram checks that start from a single sentence prompt and produce a complete free-body diagram. Justify each force direction before any calculations happen."
				},
				{
					title: "Failure Modes",
					content:
						"Common failure modes include drawing a nonexistent 'force of motion,' confusing Newton's third-law pairs with forces acting on the same object, and treating mass and weight as interchangeable."
				},
				{
					title: "Extension Project: Test of Strength",
					content:
						"Analyze a static-equilibrium scenario from a diagram, photo, simulation, or safe optional observation. Identify the forces and explain why an object can feel heavy even when it is not accelerating. The project compares sensation, force, and motion carefully without requiring suspended weights or physical materials."

		{
			title: "PHY4 Gravity, Work, and Energy",
			curriculum: [
				{
					title: "Gravity and Energy as a Unifying Theme",
					content:
						"Connect gravity to the broader idea of energy so mechanics feels like one coherent story rather than disconnected topics. Compare mass and weight, introduce gravitational potential and kinetic energy, and explain work as energy transfer. Frame energy as a bookkeeping tool for organizing many different motion situations."
				},
				{
					title: "Worked Example Set: Ball Drops, Ramps, and Pendulums",
					content:
						"Falling objects, ramp motion, and pendulum swings show energy changing form while the total stays interpretable. Use diagrams, simulation traces, provided video clips, or short datasets rather than requiring a live setup. Include at least one frictionless example and one real-world example where thermal energy matters. The central habit is describing where the energy is, not just plugging numbers into formulas."
				},
				{
					title: "Graph and Data Exercise: Height-Speed and Energy Bar Charts",
					content:
						"Use tables or simulation data showing how speed changes with height on a ramp or track. Build energy bar charts alongside numeric data so energy conservation is visible both graphically and mathematically. Compare a no-friction graph with a rough-surface graph and explain the missing mechanical energy."
				},
				{
					title: "Remote Investigation: Roller Coaster Energy Storyboard",
					content:
						"Create a storyboard for a roller coaster or skater run and label where gravitational potential, kinetic, and thermal energy are largest. Predict the speed ranking at different positions and justify their choices with energy reasoning rather than only with slope intuition."
				},
				{
					title: "Remote Investigation: Galileo's Ball Drop Revisited",
					content:
						"A provided ball-drop dataset, simulation, or video comparison revisits gravity with better measurement and cleaner reasoning than in the opening modules. The analysis separates what the evidence can actually show, what air resistance changes, and why the result supports the idea of common gravitational acceleration. Optional observations can supplement the shared evidence, but the course task remains valid without dropping objects."
				},
				{
					title: "Reflection Question: Why Is Energy Such a Useful Idea?",
					content:
						"Compare solving a motion problem with forces versus with energy. A strong response explains one case where energy makes the structure of the problem clearer and one case where force analysis is still more natural."
				}
			],
			supplementalProjects: [

					title: "Diagnostic Checkpoint",
					content:
						"Readiness check: distinguish energy stored in a system from energy transferred into or out of it. Prompt: narrate an energy story in words before writing any equations."
				},
				{
					title: "Failure Modes",
					content:
						"Common failure modes include treating energy as something that gets 'used up' rather than transferred or transformed, and assuming heavier objects fall faster simply because they have more weight."
				},
				{
					title: "Extension Project: Pendulum Design",
					content:
						"Plan a pendulum model using a simulation, diagram, or safe optional observation and explain why amplitude gradually decreases in the real world. Suggest practical ways to reduce energy loss and predict which changes would matter most. The final artifact can be a labeled diagram, short model writeup, or comparison table rather than a physical build."

		{
			title: "PHY5 Electricity and Basic Circuits",
			curriculum: [
				{
					title: "Charge, Current, Voltage, and Resistance",
					content:
						"Electricity starts with practical circuits rather than abstract field theory. Charge, current, voltage, and resistance stay tied to physical meaning. Water-flow analogies are helpful for intuition, but they are never a substitute for precise reasoning."
				},
				{
					title: "Worked Example Set: Series and Parallel Circuits",
					content:
						"Work small examples that compare bulb brightness, current paths, and the effect of opening one branch. Use Ohm's law in simple numeric settings, but keep the focus on how the circuit behaves as a system. Include troubleshooting-style questions that connect symptoms back to structure."
				},
				{
					title: "Graph and Data Exercise: Current-Voltage Tables",
					content:
						"Several provided or simulated current-voltage data points for the same resistor or circuit element support the graphing task. Graph current versus voltage, interpret the slope qualitatively, and connect the pattern to resistance. Repeated measurements still matter, and imperfections can be discussed through noisy datasets or circuit-simulator variation rather than requiring physical contacts or batteries."
				},
				{
					title: "Remote Investigation: Circuit Measurement Log",
					content:
						"Use a circuit simulator, provided schematic, or provided measurement table to compare a simple series circuit with a parallel circuit. Record predicted versus observed bulb behavior, current direction, and voltage or current values from the shared evidence. Sketch the circuit before and after the modeled change. A physical circuit build is optional only when appropriate tools and safety conditions are available."
				},
				{
					title: "Simulation Challenge: Circuit Debugging",
					content:
						"Use a simulator or drawn circuit set to diagnose why a bulb will not light, why one branch is dimmer, or why a switch placement matters. Treat debugging as a scientific reasoning task: identify the intended path, compare it to the actual path, and isolate the broken assumption."
				},
				{
					title: "Reflection Question: What Does a Diagram Hide or Reveal?",
					content:
						"Compare a physical-looking circuit image, breadboard photo, or battery-and-bulb setup with its schematic diagram. A strong response explains which representation helps more with building and which helps more with reasoning."

			supplementalProjects: [
				{
					title: "Diagnostic Checkpoint",

						"Readiness check: predict what happens when one component is removed or replaced before changing the circuit diagram or simulation. A good checkpoint explains current and voltage in the same circuit without mixing the two ideas."
				},
				{
					title: "Failure Modes",
					content:
						"Common failure modes include treating current as something that gets 'used up' by the first bulb in a series circuit, assuming a battery supplies a fixed current no matter the circuit, and confusing an open circuit with a weaker circuit rather than a broken path."
				},
				{
					title: "Extension Project: Home Device Power Survey",
					content:
						"Choose several common devices, estimate how electrical energy use differs among them, and connect those differences to power ratings and run time. This works well as a short bridge from circuits to practical energy use."

			title: "PHY6 Waves, Sound, and Light",
			curriculum: [
				{
					title: "Wave Behavior Across Media",
					content:
						"Amplitude, wavelength, frequency, and wave speed can be developed through visual and auditory examples. Mechanical waves such as sound and electromagnetic waves such as light become easier to compare once shared wave ideas are visible. The module presents physics as observable, pattern-based reasoning rather than formula memorization."
				},

					title: "Worked Example Set: Pitch, Color, and Wave Speed",
					content:
						"Work examples that connect higher frequency with higher pitch, compare louder versus softer sounds through amplitude, and relate color differences to light frequency or wavelength. Use waveform screenshots, audio-tool displays, or simulations as evidence. Include a simple wave-speed relationship problem and one example involving reflection or refraction."
				},
				{
					title: "Graph and Data Exercise: Reading Waveforms",
					content:
						"Interpret snapshots of waves and wave-versus-time graphs so amplitude, period, and wavelength can be read from more than one representation. A provided sound waveform or screenshot can be compared with the sound it represents when audio is available. Use the exercise to reinforce that graphs describe measurable quantities, not artistic shapes."
				},
				{
					title: "Remote Investigation: Resonance and Sound",
					content:
						"Use a resonance simulation, digital tone generator, provided waveform, or short demonstration clip to study resonance. Identify which variable is being changed, what happens near resonance, and how energy transfer becomes easier when frequencies match. Physical objects such as tuning forks, cups, or strings are optional examples rather than required materials."

					title: "Simulation Challenge: Light, Reflection, and Refraction",
					content:
						"Use a light simulation, ray diagram set, or provided ripple-tank/mirror clip to compare reflection and refraction. Predict path changes first, then test the prediction and explain the result using wave ideas instead of only memorized rules."

					title: "Failure Modes",
					content:
						"Common mistakes include mixing up amplitude with frequency, assuming waves always transport matter forward rather than mainly transporting energy, and thinking light needs a medium in the same way sound does."

				{
					title: "Designing a Fair Physics Investigation",
					content:
						"The capstone brings the course together by revisiting scientific questions, variables, controls, uncertainty, and model limits. A strong capstone combines conceptual understanding, graphing, experimental design, and clear communication rather than just producing a flashy result."

					content:
						"Draft and revise the final experiment, simulation, dataset analysis, or modeling challenge before full execution. Accept options such as a motion study, energy audit, bridge-force analysis, simple circuit investigation, or resonance demo when the question is narrow, the evidence source is realistic, and the plan can be completed over Zoom without special materials."

					content:
						"Before the final presentation, review the evidence chain from question to conclusion. Confirm that the independent variable, dependent variable, controlled variables, graph choice, and uncertainty notes are visible. A strong review identifies one claim the evidence supports, one claim the evidence does not fully prove, and one revision that would make the investigation more reliable."

The default format is simulation-based, dataset-based, diagram-based, or video-observation-based; physical observations are optional only when safe, simple, and available.

						"Name the system before choosing an equation: a cart pair, a ball and wall, or a person and safety device can each define different internal and external forces. Track momentum before and after the interaction, choose a positive direction, and use force-time area when the evidence is an impulse graph."

			curriculum: [
				{
					title: "Concept Path",
