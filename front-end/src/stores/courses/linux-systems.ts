					title: "Why the Linux Environment Is the Real Classroom",
					content:
						"Position the course as an operating-systems and administration class, not just a list of shell commands. Treat the Linux environment as the place where files live, services run, logs accumulate, and debugging happens, with VS Code or another editor acting only as a careful companion to terminal work."
				},
				{
					title: "Recommended Tooling on macOS",
					content:
						"On macOS, install VS Code, enable the `code` command, and prepare to work against a Linux VM, a hosted Linux box, or a remote machine over SSH. The goal is not to make macOS pretend to be Linux, but to make it easy to reach a real Linux environment and edit configuration files safely."
				},
				{
					title: "Recommended Tooling on Windows with WSL2",
					content:
						"On Windows, install WSL2 with Ubuntu, connect through the `Remote - WSL` extension, and confirm that new terminals are actually opening inside Linux rather than PowerShell. This early verification matters because the rest of the course assumes that package management, paths, permissions, and process tools are being exercised in Linux itself."
				},
				{
					title: "Course Outcomes and Daily Operating Habits",
					content:
						"By the end of the course, the expected outcome is confident filesystem navigation, config inspection and editing, service and log management, routine automation, and deployment of a small web service. Each lesson begins with a command-of-the-day drill and ends with a short note about what changed on the system, what was verified, and how to undo the change safely."

					title: "Terminal Basics, History, Pipes, Redirection, and Exit Codes",

					title: "Core Navigation and File Management Commands",
					content:
						"Practice `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `cat`, `less`, `head`, and `tail` until directory traversal no longer depends on guessing. Tie every command back to a practical question: Where am I, what files are here, what changed, and how do I inspect something without damaging it."
				},
				{
					title: "Filtering and Searching in the Shell",
					content:
						"`grep`, `find`, `rg`, `sort`, `uniq`, `wc`, and `xargs` work as a family of inspection tools rather than isolated commands. Linux work scales when a command sequence can search a tree, narrow results, count patterns, and pass findings into a follow-up command without manually copying file names around."

					title: "Build Small Pipelines Before Writing Scripts",

						"Answer concrete questions with one pipeline at a time, such as counting log lines that contain a word or finding the largest directories in a project. This frames scripting as the next step after repeatable command-line thinking instead of as a separate skill."
