			curriculum: [
				{
					title: "Introductions and Setup",
					content: `**Concept path:** Java programs move through a source-edit, compile, run, and observe cycle. A useful setup pass identifies where source files live, where compiled output appears, how the terminal reports errors, and how project folders separate one exercise from another.

**Practice targets:** Open a small Java project, identify the file containing the entry point, run it once unchanged, make one visible output change, run it again, and confirm that the displayed result came from the newest source file rather than stale output.

**Evidence target:** A reliable setup is visible when a small source change produces a predictable new console result and compile errors can be traced back to a specific file and line.`
				},
				{
					title: "Creating and Running a Java Program",
					content: `**Concept path:** A Java application starts from a class that contains the main method. The class name, file name, braces, method header, and statements work together to create the smallest runnable program.

**Practice targets:** Locate the class declaration, the main method header, and the first executable statement. Add several console outputs, distinguish fixed text from calculated values, and keep braces and semicolons aligned so the compiler can parse the program.

**Evidence target:** The program can be explained from file to class to main method to statement order, and each line of output can be traced to the exact statement that produced it.`
				},
				{
					title: "Compilation",
					content: `**Concept path:** Java source code is compiled before execution. Compilation catches syntax and type errors, then produces bytecode that the Java runtime executes. Runtime behavior begins only after the compiler accepts the source.

**Practice targets:** Create and fix common compile-time errors such as missing semicolons, mismatched braces, wrong capitalization, and incompatible assignments. Then compare them with runtime or logic errors where the program compiles but behaves incorrectly.

**Evidence target:** Error messages are useful when the filename, line number, symbol name, and surrounding code are read together instead of treating the first red message as a mystery.`
				},
				{
					title: "Variables, Primitive Data Types, and Strings",
					content: `**Concept path:** Variables name stored values, while types describe what operations are valid. Primitive types such as int, boolean, and double store direct values. String values are objects, so they support methods such as length(), charAt(), substring(), and equals().

**Practice targets:** Declare variables with meaningful names, update them safely, combine text with numeric values, and compare strings using equals() rather than ==. Include small checks for off-by-one indexing, integer division, and boolean expressions.

**Evidence target:** A strong solution makes each variable's role obvious, produces correct output for more than one input, and avoids relying on accidental string or numeric behavior.`
				},
				{
					title: "Input, Output, and Commenting",
					content: `**Concept path:** Console programs become interactive when Scanner reads typed input and output statements explain what is needed next. print() keeps output on the same line, println() ends the line, and comments preserve reasoning that is not obvious from code alone.

**Practice targets:** Read strings, integers, and decimal values; name prompts clearly; handle the common nextInt() then nextLine() newline issue; and keep comments focused on purpose, assumptions, or a non-obvious decision.

**Evidence target:** The program is readable from the console alone: prompts describe the expected input, output spacing is intentional, and comments clarify reasoning rather than repeating the statement literally.`
				},
				{
					title: "AJ1 Project 1: Mad Libs",
					content: `**Project target:** Build a console Mad Libs program that collects several typed words, stores each value in a descriptive variable, and inserts those values into a complete story.

**Build path:** Plan the story before coding so every blank has a clear part of speech. Then create prompts, read input with Scanner, combine fixed text with variables, and preserve spacing, punctuation, and line breaks.

**Evidence target:** The story remains readable after multiple runs with different inputs, and the source code clearly separates input collection from final story output.`,

					title: "AJ1 Project 2: Chat Bot",
					content: `**Project target:** Create a console chatbot that collects responses, stores them in variables, and produces replies that depend on earlier input.

**Build path:** Keep each prompt short and specific, normalize text where needed, and use conditionals for at least a few different response paths. A fallback response keeps the conversation stable when input does not match the expected wording.

**Evidence target:** The chatbot has a repeatable conversation flow, at least one branch based on typed input, and output that makes sense even when responses vary.`,

			title: "AJ2 Review: Arrays and ArrayLists",
			curriculum: [
				{
					title: "Review Focus",
					content: `**Concept path:** Arrays and ArrayLists both store ordered collections, but they make different tradeoffs. Arrays have fixed length and direct indexed storage. ArrayLists resize and provide methods for insertion, removal, and replacement.

**Practice targets:** Compare length with size(), index access with get(), assignment with set(), and fixed storage with dynamic growth. Include at least one example where an array is the simpler structure and one where an ArrayList is more appropriate.

**Evidence target:** Collection code is strongest when index bounds, mutation points, and traversal order are visible and tested with empty, single-item, and multi-item cases.`
				},
				{
					title: "Arrays",
					content: `**Concept path:** Arrays are fixed-size ordered collections where every element has the same type. Indexing starts at 0, the final valid index is length - 1, and direct access is fast when the index is known.

**Practice targets:** Create arrays with explicit values and with a size only, fill them with loops, read and update individual elements, and print them with both standard loops and enhanced for loops where mutation is not needed.

**Evidence target:** Correct array code avoids off-by-one errors, handles the first and last element deliberately, and does not use an index outside the valid range.`
				},
				{
					title: "AJ2 Project 1: Array Practice",
					content: `**Project target:** Write a group of array utility methods that transform values, compute totals, generate random data, and summarize strings.

**Build path:** Keep each method responsible for one task: double numeric values, sum even numbers, generate random doubles, or total word lengths. Use parameters and return values so methods can be tested without rewriting the main method every time.

**Evidence target:** Each method has at least one standard scenario plus one edge case, such as an empty array, a one-element array, or an array with no even numbers.`,

				},
				{
					title: "Two-Dimensional Arrays",
					content: `**Concept path:** A two-dimensional array is an array of rows, and each row contains elements at column indices. This structure is useful for grids, tables, matrices, maps, and board-like data.

**Practice targets:** Access a specific row and column, traverse by rows, traverse by columns when appropriate, and distinguish the number of rows from the number of columns. Include rectangular arrays as well as square arrays so the two dimensions are not accidentally treated as identical.

**Evidence target:** Nested-loop code is correct when the outer and inner bounds match the actual row and column lengths, not a memorized size.`
				},
				{
					title: "AJ2 Project 2: Two-Dimensional Array Practice",
					content: `**Project target:** Build utility methods for square grids and general matrices, including filling, printing, maximum search, random generation, and target search.

**Build path:** Use predictable small matrices before adding random values. Print intermediate grids in a readable row-and-column layout so incorrect indexing is visible.

**Evidence target:** The methods work for targets at the first cell, last cell, middle cells, and missing values, and maximum-value logic handles negative numbers as well as positive numbers.`,

				},
				{
					title: "ArrayLists",
					content: `**Concept path:** ArrayLists are resizable lists backed by object references. They trade fixed-size simplicity for methods that make insertion, deletion, replacement, and dynamic growth easier.

**Practice targets:** Use add(), get(), set(), remove(), contains(), and size() in small examples. Pay special attention to removal while iterating because removing an item shifts later indices left.

**Evidence target:** ArrayList code is reliable when it clearly handles changing size, avoids skipped elements during removal, and chooses wrapper types such as Integer for primitive-style values.`
				},
				{
					title: "Primitive Wrapper Objects",
					content: `**Concept path:** Java generics work with reference types, so collections such as ArrayList use wrapper classes like Integer, Double, Boolean, and Character instead of primitive types directly. Autoboxing converts a primitive into its wrapper when needed, and unboxing converts it back.

**Practice targets:** Create ArrayList<Integer> and ArrayList<Double> examples, perform arithmetic with retrieved values, and identify where Java converts between primitive and wrapper forms automatically.

**Evidence target:** Code that uses wrappers well avoids null unboxing errors and keeps numeric intent clear despite the object wrapper around the value.`
				},
				{
					title: "AJ2 Project 3: ArrayList Practice",
					content: `**Project target:** Build ArrayList methods that filter values, search for a pair with a target relationship, remove an extreme value, and append summary data.

**Build path:** Use separate methods for filtering even numbers, checking for two values that sum to zero, removing the smallest value, and appending the total sum. Keep mutation explicit so it is clear which methods modify the original list.

**Evidence target:** The project handles duplicates, all-negative lists, all-positive lists, empty lists where relevant, and lists where the smallest value appears more than once.`,

					content: `**Project target:** Store numeric test scores, compute summary statistics, and convert the average into a letter-grade category.

**Build path:** Validate the score range, calculate the total and average with clear numeric types, and use conditionals that make grade boundaries unambiguous.

**Evidence target:** Boundary cases such as exactly 90, exactly 80, a perfect score, and a low score produce the expected category.`,

					title: "AJ2 Supplemental Project 2: Matrix Addition",
					content: `**Project target:** Add two matrices by combining entries at matching row and column positions.

**Build path:** Confirm that both matrices have compatible dimensions, traverse rows and columns with nested loops, and store each sum in a result matrix rather than overwriting input data too early.

**Evidence target:** The output matrix has the same dimensions as the inputs, and each cell can be verified by one hand calculation.`,

**Build path:** Store available ingredients, collect selected ingredients, preserve ordering where it matters, and create abbreviations through a clear rule rather than hard-coded output only.

**Evidence target:** Repeated ingredients, missing ingredients, and differently ordered selections produce predictable results.`,

		{
			title: "AJ3 Review: Objects and Classes",
			curriculum: [
				{
					title: "Object-Oriented Programming",
					content: `**Concept path:** Object-oriented Java is clearest when each class owns one coherent responsibility. A class defines the fields and behavior available to its objects, while each object stores its own state.

**Practice targets:** Identify which data belongs in fields, which behavior belongs in methods, and which setup belongs in constructors. Separate object state from local variables so long-lived information is stored in the correct place.

**Evidence target:** A class is well-shaped when another file can create objects, call public methods, and understand the object state without directly editing private data.`
				},
				{
					title: "Public and Private Instance Variables",
					content: `**Concept path:** Encapsulation protects object state by keeping fields private and exposing controlled operations through methods. Public fields make quick experiments easy, but they also allow invalid state from anywhere in the program.

**Practice targets:** Convert public fields into private fields, add getters and setters where useful, and enforce at least one rule inside a setter or constructor.

**Evidence target:** Invalid values are rejected or normalized at the class boundary instead of requiring every caller to remember the same rule.`
				},
				{
					title: "Constructors",
					content: `**Concept path:** Constructors establish an object's starting state. A no-argument constructor provides a default setup, while overloaded constructors allow specific starting values.

**Practice targets:** Write multiple constructors for the same class, use this to resolve field and parameter names, and avoid duplicated setup logic when one constructor can delegate to another.

**Evidence target:** Every constructed object begins in a valid state, and object creation examples show why each constructor signature exists.`
				},
				{
					title: "Class Methods",
					content: `**Concept path:** Methods define what an object can do. Accessor methods expose state safely, mutator methods update state according to rules, and toString() creates a readable summary for debugging and display.

**Practice targets:** Write getters, setters, behavior methods, and a toString() method that includes the important fields without exposing implementation details unnecessarily.

**Evidence target:** Method calls read naturally from the outside of the class and keep state changes inside the class's rules.`
				},
				{
					title: "AJ3 Project 1: Student Class",
					content: `**Project target:** Create a Student class that stores identity and academic data with private fields and public methods.

**Build path:** Define fields, constructors, getters, setters, validation rules, and a toString() method. Then create several Student objects from main and update them through methods rather than direct field access.

**Evidence target:** The class supports valid object creation, readable output, controlled updates, and at least one rejected or corrected invalid value.`,

					solutionLink:
						"https://github.com/instruction-material/Java-Level-3/tree/main/AJ3-Student-Class"
				},
				{
					title: "Static Variables and Methods",
					content: `**Concept path:** Static members belong to the class itself rather than to one object. They are useful for shared constants, class-wide counters, utility methods, and state that genuinely applies across all instances.

**Practice targets:** Add a static counter such as numStudents, update it during construction, expose it through a static getter, and compare it with an instance field that differs for each object.

**Evidence target:** The output distinguishes per-object state from class-wide state, and static data is not used as a shortcut for information that belongs in each object.`
				},
				{
					title: "Inheritance and Subclasses",
					content: `**Concept path:** Inheritance models an is-a relationship: a subclass is a more specific version of its superclass. The subclass inherits accessible behavior, can add new behavior, and can override methods when the general behavior is not specific enough.

**Practice targets:** Create a superclass with shared fields and methods, extend it with a subclass, call super() from the subclass constructor, and override one method with more specific behavior.

**Evidence target:** Shared behavior appears only once in the superclass, while subclass-specific details stay in the subclass.`
				},
				{
					title: "AJ3 Project 2: BakedGood Class",
					content: `**Project target:** Create a BakedGood model that can grow from a basic class into a small inheritance hierarchy.

**Build path:** Store common baked-good data such as name, ingredients, quantity, and size-related information. Then identify which behavior belongs to all baked goods and which behavior varies by subtype.

**Evidence target:** The base class is useful on its own as a shared model and also prepares cleanly for later abstract classes, interfaces, and enum-based constraints.`,
					projectLink:
						"https://github.com/instruction-material/Java-Level-3/tree/main/AJ3-Baked-Good",
					solutionLink:
						"https://github.com/instruction-material/Java-Level-3/tree/main/AJ3-Baked-Good"
				},
				{
					title: "Abstract Classes and Methods",
					content: `**Concept path:** Abstract classes define shared state or behavior while leaving some details incomplete. Abstract methods name behavior that every concrete subclass must provide.

**Practice targets:** Convert a general class into an abstract class, add an abstract method for price calculation, and implement that method in a concrete subclass such as Bread.

**Evidence target:** The abstract type captures common structure without pretending that every baked good uses the same pricing rule.`
				},
				{
					title: "Interfaces",
					content: `**Concept path:** Interfaces define capabilities without committing to one inheritance tree. A class can implement an interface to promise that certain methods exist, even when the class already extends another type.

**Practice targets:** Create a ForSale-style interface, implement its methods, and use Comparable or Comparator to order baked goods by a meaningful property such as ingredient count or price.

**Evidence target:** Interface-based code can operate on any object that provides the promised behavior, not just one specific class name.`
				},
				{
					title: "Enums",
					content: `**Concept path:** Enums represent a fixed set of named choices. They make code safer than loose strings when only a small number of values are valid.

**Practice targets:** Replace string-based categories with enum constants such as loaf sizes, pass enum values through constructors, and use switch expressions or conditionals where behavior depends on the chosen constant.

**Evidence target:** Invalid category names cannot be created by typo, and every valid enum value has a clear meaning in the program.`

			title: "AJ4 Recursion",
			curriculum: [
				{
					title: "Recursion",
					content: `**Concept path:** Recursive methods solve a problem by calling themselves on a smaller version of the same problem. Each method needs a base case that stops the chain and a recursive case that moves toward that stop condition.

**Practice targets:** Identify the base case, identify what gets smaller, trace several calls by hand, and compare the recursive solution with an iterative loop when both versions are reasonable.

**Evidence target:** A recursive method is valid when every allowed input eventually reaches a base case and each returned value contributes to the larger answer correctly.`
				},
				{
					title: "Sum of the First N Numbers",
					content: `**Concept path:** Summing the first n numbers is a compact recursion example because sum(n) can be described as n plus sum(n - 1), with sum(1) as a natural stopping point.

**Practice targets:** Trace sum(4) or sum(5) as a stack of calls, then unwind the returns in the opposite direction. Compare that trace with a loop that accumulates the same total.

**Evidence target:** The trace shows both the downward call phase and the upward return phase, not just the final numeric answer.`
				},
				{
					title: "Call Stack",
					content: `**Concept path:** Every method call gets a stack frame containing its local variables and return location. Recursion creates many frames, so missing or unreachable base cases can produce stack overflow.

**Practice targets:** Draw stack frames for a short recursive call, label the parameter values in each frame, and identify exactly where execution resumes after a recursive call returns.

**Evidence target:** Stack reasoning explains why recursion can be elegant but not free: each call has memory and control-flow overhead.`
				},
				{
					title: "AJ4 Project 1: Recursion Practice",
					content: `**Project target:** Implement several recursive methods that use different recursive patterns: numeric countdown, digit decomposition, branching recursion, and string narrowing.

**Build path:** Create methods for exponents, factorials, digit sums, Fibonacci numbers, and palindrome checking. For each method, write the base case first, then define how the input moves closer to it.

**Evidence target:** Each method includes small test calls whose answers can be checked mentally, plus at least one edge case such as zero, one, an empty string, or a one-character string.`,

					title: "AJ4 Project 2: Divisible by 7",

**Build path:** Encode the divisibility rule carefully, print or trace intermediate values during early testing, and stop at a small enough base case to decide true or false.

**Evidence target:** The method agrees with direct modulo checks for several positive numbers, including values that are divisible by 7, not divisible by 7, and already small.`,

			curriculum: [
				{
					title: "Linear Search",
					content: `**Concept path:** Linear search scans a collection one item at a time. It works on unsorted data, sorted data, arrays, ArrayLists, and many other sequential structures because it makes no ordering assumption.

**Practice targets:** Trace searches where the target is first, middle, last, and missing. Return either the matching index, the matching value, or a boolean result depending on the method contract.

**Contract check:** Decide what the method promises before writing the loop. A method that returns an index does not also print the answer, and a method that returns true or false keeps location details out of the contract when the caller only needs membership.

**Evidence target:** Runtime reasoning distinguishes best case, worst case, and average case rather than treating every search as the same amount of work. A strong trace names how many comparisons happened and why the loop stopped.`
				},
				{
					title: "AJ5 Project 1: Linear Search Implementation",
					content: `**Project target:** Implement a linear search method with a clear contract: return the target index when found and -1 when absent.

**Build path:** Traverse from left to right, check each element once, return immediately when the target is found, and return -1 only after the loop finishes without a match.

**Evidence target:** Tests cover the first index, a later index, repeated values, a missing value, and an empty array if the method accepts one.`,

				{
					title: "Introduction to Big-O Analysis",
					content: `**Concept path:** Big-O notation describes how runtime or memory use grows as input size grows. It ignores constant factors and lower-order terms so algorithms can be compared by their long-term growth pattern.

**Practice targets:** Classify constant, logarithmic, linear, linearithmic, quadratic, and exponential patterns. Simplify expressions by keeping the dominant term and dropping constants.

**Comparison habit:** Use the same input variable when comparing algorithms. Searching one array of size n and then sorting a different list of size m uses separate labels unless the relationship between n and m is stated.

**Evidence target:** A runtime claim is tied to a counted operation, a variable input size, and a reason the dominant term controls growth. The explanation predicts what changes when the input doubles.`
				},
				{
					title: "AJ5 Project 2: Big-O Practice",
					content: `**Project target:** Analyze runtime expressions and connect each simplified Big-O result to a concrete algorithm pattern.

**Build path:** For each expression, identify the dominant term, remove constants, and explain what kind of code shape could produce that growth, such as one loop, nested loops, repeated halving, or recursive branching.

**Evidence target:** The explanation is stronger than the label alone because it links the notation to a real control-flow pattern.`,

**Evidence target:** Strong comparisons explain not only which algorithm is faster, but why its control flow produces that growth pattern.`,

**Evidence target:** The answer names the sorted boundary and explains why the selected value is final after the pass ends.`

						"**Concept path:** Java concurrency begins with bounded task execution rather than raw thread chaos. An executor manages a controlled pool of workers, while each task keeps its input clear and reports its result through a stable return value or future.\n**Core topics:** `Runnable`, `Callable`, `ExecutorService`, futures, immutable task inputs, deterministic reporting, synchronized shared state when necessary, and ownership rules for mutable data.\n**Safety checkpoint:** Most beginner concurrency bugs come from unclear ownership of mutable state. A correct design identifies which data is task-local, which data is shared, and which code is allowed to mutate shared state."

					title: "Capstone Architecture and Java-Specific Readiness",
					content:
						"**Concept path:** The capstone brings the advanced Java track together through explicit architecture decisions. Packages, service boundaries, interfaces, data models, test harnesses, error handling, and one concurrency or event-processing component all need a clear reason to exist.\n**Readiness target:** A strong capstone demonstrates preparation for serious Java design-pattern work, larger data-structure projects, or a service/application course. The code is explainable by responsibilities and data flow, not only by a list of files.\n**Review target:** The final review identifies one strong design choice, one tradeoff that was accepted deliberately, and one concrete improvement that would make the system easier to test, extend, or debug."

					title: "AJ22 Project 1: Concurrent Task Runner",
					content:
						"Build a task runner that accepts jobs, executes them with a small executor pool, records success or failure, and prints a final report in deterministic order. The design explanation names task-local data, shared data, synchronization or immutability choices, and the reason the final output remains stable even when tasks finish in different orders.",

					content:
						"Build a medium-size simulation such as a tournament scheduler, delivery dispatch board, library queue, or course registration system. It must include packages, interfaces, persistent input/output, tests or test harnesses, and a clear event loop or task-processing model.",
