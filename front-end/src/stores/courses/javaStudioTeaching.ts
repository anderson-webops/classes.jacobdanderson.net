			"Strategy places interchangeable algorithms behind one operation. Here Plan is a closed choice of BULK, FLAT or MEMBER. PricingRule is a function from a validated quantity to integer cents. CartPricer selects a rule; quote and receipt must agree about the same order. A rule object owns an algorithm, while CartPricer owns selection and receipt formatting.\n\nThe starter repeats pricing in quote and receipt. Extracting one helper removes that duplication without introducing a strategy map. The reference instead has BulkRule, FlatRule and MemberRule behind PricingRule; MemberRule reuses BulkRule. Compare the actual change pressure and file/setup cost. Passing the same output checks establishes behavior preservation, while the dependency map and decision record establish what structural change occurred.\n\n### Supplied contract\n\nQuantities are whole integers from 0 through 1000. Prices are whole cents.\nPlans are BULK, FLAT and MEMBER.\n\n| Plan | Unit price or rule |\n| --- | --- |\n| BULK, 0\u20134 units | 350 cents per unit |\n| BULK, 5\u20139 units | 300 cents per unit |\n| BULK, 10\u20131000 units | 250 cents per unit |\n| FLAT | 400 cents per unit |\n| MEMBER | 90% of the BULK total, using integer arithmetic |\n\n`CartPricer.quote(plan, units)` returns the total. `receipt` returns exactly\n`PLAN|units|total`. Null plan raises NullPointerException before quantity\nvalidation. An out-of-range quantity raises IllegalArgumentException.\nThe same inputs can be reused; these operations have no external effects.\nPricingRule implementations receive an already validated quantity.\n\nFor six units, BULK = 1800, FLAT = 2400 and MEMBER = 1620 cents.\nBulk boundaries are 4 \u2192 1400, 5 \u2192 1500, 9 \u2192 2700 and 10 \u2192 2500.\nZero costs zero for every built-in plan.\n\n### Native Java workflow\n\nUse JDK 21 and keep the exported role folder together, including its src packages and sources.txt. The starter already passes core. The optional operation is deliberately unfinished there.\n\n```sh\njavac --release 21 -Xlint:all -Werror -d classes @sources.txt\njava -cp classes ContractTests base\njava -cp classes ContractTests core\njava -cp classes Main base\njava -cp classes Main\n```"

A helper-only cleanup can improve its readability. The reference moves business rules to NotebookService, storage to MemoryNotes and setup to Composition. Its application imports api and ports, and compiles with a fake repository without memory or Composition. This is a demonstrated substitution seam.
