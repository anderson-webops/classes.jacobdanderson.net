		"Start with four blocks, not a blank screen. An event is the trigger; the block beneath it is the action. Predict, press a key, then change one value. Keep the original working script beside your addition.",
	"Position and reset":
		"Drag a sprite to the place you want it, read x and y, and only then choose a motion block. Use the green flag to restore the starting scene and a click event to act. Compare an immediate go to with a timed glide. A layer block changes overlap, not position.",
	"Dialogue and scenes":
		"The stage owns backdrops; sprites own their own scripts. First use an event to change scenes. Then use a named broadcast to hand the next turn to another sprite. Run two scripts together and notice why a wait or message matters.",
	"Loops and animation":
		"First build a short sequence that works once. Put that sequence inside repeat when you know the count, or forever until you press Stop. Predict the final direction and use a wait to make the intermediate actions visible.",
	"Conditions and decisions":
		"An if block asks a true-or-false question. Keep movement events working while a separate loop checks the wall. Compare touching a wall with touching the goal. Only add and/or after each individual condition works.",
	"Variables and games":
		"A variable remembers a value between events. Choose a meaningful name, reset it on the flag, and change it at exactly the event that earns a point. Combine earlier skills into a game whose rules you can explain to a partner."
