					title: "macOS and Windows Walkthroughs",
					content:
						"On macOS, install Apple command-line tools with `xcode-select --install`, then verify the compiler and debugger from a terminal. On Windows, prefer WSL2 with Ubuntu so the shell, assembler workflow, and debugger behavior stay close to the Unix-style examples used throughout the course."
				},
				{
					title: "Architecture Choice and Syntax Policy",
					content:
						"Use `x86-64 assembly` first because the debugger support, desktop relevance, and reverse-engineering value are stronger for a first course than jumping immediately into other architectures. Pick one syntax for active writing, and this course standardizes on Intel syntax while still showing how to recognize AT&T syntax in compiler output and external references."

					title: "Audience, Prerequisites, and Core Outcomes",
					content:
						"Position the course after `C Systems Engineering` or equivalent low-level C work. Already be comfortable with pointers, structs, stack versus heap, compilation, and debugger basics before the course asks them to read registers, trace stack frames, and explain calling conventions at the instruction level."
