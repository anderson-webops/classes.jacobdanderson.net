					title: "macOS and Windows Walkthroughs",
					content:
						"On Windows, use an x86-64 WSL2 Linux distribution. On macOS—especially Apple Silicon—use a supported x86-64 Linux VM or remote lab environment for the required path rather than mixing native ARM64 instructions, Mach-O conventions, or the Apple ABI into Linux examples. Native ARM64 comparison belongs in the optional archive after the baseline traces are stable."
				},
				{
					title: "Architecture Choice and Syntax Policy",
					content:
						"Use `x86-64 assembly` first because the debugger support, desktop relevance, and reverse-engineering value are strong for a first course. The required path writes GNU/Clang `.S` source with `.intel_syntax noprefix` and follows the System V AMD64 ABI on Linux. AT&T syntax, NASM syntax, Windows x64 conventions, Mach-O, and ARM64 are recognized as distinct variants rather than silently mixed into active code."

						"Position the course after `C Systems Engineering` or equivalent low-level C work. Already be comfortable with pointers, structs, stack versus heap, compilation, and debugger basics before the course asks them to read registers, trace stack frames, and explain calling conventions at the instruction level."

						"Use a focused trace worksheet for expansion ideas and next steps that records the key registers, flag changes, memory addresses, and one plain-language explanation of why the control flow moved the way it did. Focus especially on which next specialization fits the current strengths and why; the worksheet narrates instruction flow rather than only skimming mnemonics. A complete entry records the instruction address, the value before the instruction, the value after the instruction, and the evidence that explains the next branch, call, or return. The final note connects the chosen specialization to a concrete trace skill already demonstrated.",
