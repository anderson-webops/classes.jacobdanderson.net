An acute angle is between 0 and 90 degrees, a right angle is 90 degrees, an obtuse angle is between 90 and 180 degrees, and a straight angle is 180 degrees. Complementary angles sum to 90 degrees; supplementary angles sum to 180 degrees. Vertical angles are opposite angles made by two intersecting lines and are congruent. Adjacent angles share a vertex and side with disjoint interiors. A linear pair is adjacent with opposite outer rays, so it is supplementary.",
