						"A plain value type or small immutable object can remove the need for a pattern entirely. In C++, some creation and wrapper patterns only become justified once polymorphism, shared lifetime, or runtime variability is actually needed. Compare both designs before choosing: a value-based object is easier to copy, test, and reason about, while reference-based design can support shared identity, substitution, and late binding. The design decision names the lifetime owner, copy behavior, mutation boundary, and reason a simpler value type was or was not enough."
