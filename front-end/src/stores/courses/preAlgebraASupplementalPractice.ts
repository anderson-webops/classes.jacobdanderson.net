			"Find 3/4+1/6 as a simplified exact fraction. State the common denominator.",
			"Find 15% of 60 and the distance from -8 to zero on a number line. Keep the percent result separate from the distance."
		],
		checks: "The operation order is explicit, equal-sized fraction parts share a denominator, and signed position is distinguished from distance."

			"A batch of 6 bars uses 3/4 cup of oats. Find the oats needed for 10 bars at the same recipe ratio.",
			"The ingredients for 6 bars cost $18. At the same cost per bar, find the cost of 10 bars.",
			"With 2 cups of oats and no other ingredient limit, find the greatest whole number of bars possible. Verify that one additional bar would exceed the oats available."

			"Repeat the same two moves starting at level 7. Compare the final level, total distance and displacement with the first trip."

			"Find the total number of tiles in the first 10 rows. Show either paired first/last terms or the arithmetic-series formula.",
			"Change the first row to 3 tiles and keep the increase of 4 tiles per row. Find the new row-n expression and first-10-row total. Explain the difference between the two totals without listing every row."

		checks: "The row index starts at 1, the constant difference is retained, and a single-row count is distinguished from a sum."

			"Calculate (3×10^5)×(4×10^(-3)) and write the result in normalized scientific notation."
