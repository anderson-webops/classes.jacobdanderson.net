Keep `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic` enabled, use `CTest` or an equivalent deterministic harness, and run AddressSanitizer/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer or the closest supported diagnostic before the course depends on unsafe buffers, binary inspection, or dynamic allocation."

Every unit pairs the abstract idea with a printed byte or memory view plus a short written explanation of why the code works."

			"container contract",
			"representation invariant",
			"ownership",
			"operation cost",
			"failure preservation"

			"Select a structure from the operations and ownership it needs rather than from familiarity. Extend the ring buffer only after documenting head/count/capacity rules, then check boundary operations, failed growth, ordering after wraparound, cleanup, and the expected cost of each public operation."
