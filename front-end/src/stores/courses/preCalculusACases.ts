The zero -2 has odd multiplicity, so the graph crosses there. The zero 1 has even multiplicity, so the graph touches and turns there.\n3. `p(0) = 2` gives the y-intercept. Since the square factor is positive away from 1, the sign is negative to the left of -2 and positive to its right, except at the zeros.\n4. Draw a smooth curve through those features.

Because f increases, the left estimate is below and the right estimate above the area. For this straight line, the trapezoid formula gives the exact area `(2)(1 + 3)/2 = 4`, also `(L_4 + R_4)/2`.\n\nMidpoint rectangles use each interval's midpoint as the height input.

At -1 the simplified denominator is nonzero, so there is a hole at `(-1, -1/3)`. At 2 it remains zero, giving a vertical asymptote `x = 2`.\n3.
