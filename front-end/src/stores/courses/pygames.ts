For example, \`alien.bottomleft = (0, HEIGHT)\` places the alien's lower-left corner at the lower-left edge of the window.

**Practice checks:**
- Move the same alien with at least three different position keywords and describe which anchor point is being controlled.
- Compare changing \`alien.x\` directly with changing \`alien.center\` or \`alien.bottomleft\`.
- Improve wrapping logic so the alien fully leaves the screen before reappearing: \`if alien.left > WIDTH: alien.right = 0\` in \`update()\`.`

- Experiment with RGB color values such as \`(255, 0, 0)\`, \`(0, 255, 0)\`, and \`(0, 0, 255)\`.

- In \`update()\`, move the alien with the arrow keys and move the ball using its speed attributes.
- Bounce the ball off the window edges by reversing the relevant speed.
- When the alien collides with the ball, increase \`score\` and move the ball to a new random position.
- In \`draw()\`, draw both actors and show the score with \`screen.draw.text(str(score), (10, 10))\`.

- Create an alien that changes to a "hurt" image when clicked.
- Define \`setAlienNormal()\` to restore the alien's normal image.
- In the click handler, call \`clock.schedule_unique(setAlienNormal, 1.0)\` so the hurt image lasts one second while the game keeps running.

**Repeated schedule:**
- Define \`moveRandom()\` to move the alien to a random screen position.
- When the player presses space, call \`clock.schedule_interval(moveRandom, 0.5)\` so the alien teleports every half second.
- When the player presses "s", call \`clock.unschedule(moveRandom)\` to stop the repeated movement.

**Key distinction:** \`schedule_unique\` runs once after a delay, \`schedule_interval\` runs repeatedly, and \`unschedule\` cancels scheduled callbacks.`

						"Levels keep games challenging by changing layout, difficulty, or goals over time. Pre-generated levels use fixed layouts, specific enemy or power-up locations, and designed maps; randomized levels spawn enemies or collectibles at random positions or times. Many games mix both approaches by using a pre-built map with some random enemy or item spawns. A global level variable can track the current level and drive logic such as difficulty, spawn rates, and layout changes. Connect this to gameState so it is clear which screen is active versus which level is being played."

**Screen flow and setup:**
- On the start screen, let the player select easy, medium, or hard difficulty.
- Initialize the player with 3 lives and 3 numbered blocks in level 1.
- Use \`music.play("tune.mp3")\` for background music.

**Level behavior:**
- For each level, display purple tiles that show numbers in order.
- After the player clicks the tile labeled "1", hide the numbers on the other tiles and start a timer.
- Track the next expected number with a variable.
- When the player clicks the correct tile, play a chime and keep that tile's number visible.
- Store and increment the current level, then scale the number of tiles as levels increase.

- When lives reach zero, show a game-over screen with options to play again or quit using space and Escape.
- When all 15 levels are completed, show a winning end screen with a short congratulatory message and restart options.

**Player and motion:**
- Create a diver Actor controlled with the arrow keys.
- Apply gravity and friction in both x and y directions for an underwater feel.
- Prevent the diver from leaving the screen.

**Shark behavior:**
- Add a shark Actor with dynamic \`shark.xspeed\` and \`shark.yspeed\`.
- First test the shark with fixed speeds so movement and wall behavior are easy to debug.
- Define \`setDirection()\` to compute speeds that move the shark toward the diver's current position. This is similar to the vector math used in the Golf project to move a ball toward a click.
- Use \`clock.schedule_interval(setDirection, 1.0)\` so the shark retargets the diver every second instead of every frame.

**Hiding mechanic:**
- Add a seaweed Actor.
- Modify \`setDirection()\` so that if the diver is fully inside the seaweed, the shark receives random speeds instead of targeting the diver. This simulates the shark losing sight of the player.

**Scoring and ending:** Create a school of fish that swim across the screen and award points when collected. Add game-over logic when the shark catches the diver and use clear game-state values for play, win, loss, or restart screens.

						"Review what went into building Space Invaders and identify which parts of the course felt strongest and which parts still need reinforcement. Use that reflection to decide whether the next step should be Python Level 2 or additional PyGame fundamentals practice."
				},
				{
					title: "PyG12 Project 1: Master Project",
					content:
						"Scope and build an original Master Project that showcases everything learned. Start by identifying favorite game mechanics and brainstorming ideas that fit the available project window. Once a concept is chosen, write out the steps needed to program the project, including actors, physics, projectiles, screens, levels, and any AI behaviors desired. Aim for independent implementation with the shared work focused on planning, debugging, and architectural decisions rather than typing every line. A focused project that spans about two weeks of work is usually a better fit than an oversized idea that cannot be finished cleanly."
				},
				{
					title: "Bonus Concepts for Assets",
					content:
						"If the project uses images or sounds outside the provided asset bank, prototype with temporary assets first and then replace them with final files later. Resize image files so they match practical sprite sizes, crop or normalize sounds when needed, and explore the PyGame Zero documentation for ideas such as more advanced input, music control, and simple particle effects that can make the Master Project feel more polished."

				{
					title: "Master Project Presentation",
					content:
						"Once the project reaches a solid milestone, present the game and explain the concept, how the code is structured, what problems were solved along the way, and which course concepts were used (actors, physics, projectiles, AI, game states, and levels). Treat the result as a portfolio-quality project summary rather than as a casual show-and-tell."
				},
				{
					title: "Course Recap & Next Course",
					content:
						"Wrap up by recapping the main ideas from the entire PyGame course: actors, events, physics, platforms, projectiles, enemy AI, levels, and game states. Then connect those habits directly to Python Level 2: lists of actors, dictionaries for state, helper functions for logic separation, and classes for larger projects all transfer cleanly into the next Python course."
				},
				{
					title: "Bridge to Larger Python Projects",
					content:
						"Make the transition explicit from game-specific code to broader Python engineering. Leave knowing how to break a large project into helpers, how to move from one-file scripts toward more organized structures, and why the PyGames course is a stepping stone rather than a side branch."
