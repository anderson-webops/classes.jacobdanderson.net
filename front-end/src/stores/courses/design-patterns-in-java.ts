					title: "Pattern, Anti-Pattern, and Overengineering",

				},

					title: "Code Smell Survey Before Pattern Selection",
					content:
						"The smell categories that drive this course are bloaters, object-orientation abusers, change preventers, dispensables, and couplers. Beginner-friendly examples such as long methods, switch statements, duplicate code, data clumps, feature envy, and shotgun surgery show why architecture pain appears."
