The existing algorithm remains useful: a port preserves its promised inputs, outputs and state changes while adapting types, syntax and files. Choose Java or C++ as the first target throughout the four shared stages, then complete that language’s exit and capstone. The other target is an optional extension. This authored transition course prepares an experienced Python learner for the main Java or C++ sequence; it does not replace either full introductory course. Start each exercise by predicting the Python result, mapping its data and control flow, and only then editing the target starter. During a facilitated session, explain the prediction and one type decision before running."

					"Compiled vs. Interpreted Workflows",
					"Python runs a script with `python3 file.py`. A native Java workflow compiles source with JDK 21 using `javac *.java`, then runs the class with `java Main`; use `Main`, without `.java` or `.class`, in the run command. A native C++17 workflow compiles all source files with `c++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -I. *.cpp -o bridge`, then runs `./bridge`. Open a starter with the site’s matching IDE button, confirm the import, read its README and preserve all files. Save and download a project ZIP, extract it, then use the documented native commands. The Java browser runner is a limited preview, so native Java is the authoritative workflow for these projects, especially the class port and capstone. C++ uses native compilation. Importing does not execute code. A compiler error prevents execution; a runtime error occurs after a successful build. Fix the first relevant diagnostic before investigating later messages."
				],
				[
					"Blocks, Braces, and Signatures",
					"Python uses indentation to group a block. Java and C++ use `{` and `}`; indentation still makes the nesting readable, and most simple statements end in `;`. A Python assignment can bind a name to another kind of object later. A typed declaration such as `int count = 3;` fixes that variable’s declared type. Java writes Boolean values as `boolean`; C++ uses `bool`. Java methods belong to a class; the supplied `static` helpers can be called without constructing an object. C++ free functions can appear outside a class. Both languages declare a return type and parameter types before the body. For a tiny condition or loop, mark the opening and closing block, trace the same values as Python, and predict which statement runs next. Avoid changing the algorithm while resolving the syntax."
				],
				[
					"What Transfers Cleanly from Python",
					"Decomposition, conditions, iteration and object state transfer across all three languages. Library spelling and numeric behavior may differ. Python integers can grow; Java `int` has a fixed 32-bit range, and native C++ `int` width depends on its implementation. Integer division in Java/C++ discards the fractional part toward zero; Python `/` returns a floating-point result and `//` floors. Strings and collections also have different APIs and representations. A port therefore needs an explicit input domain and shared fixtures, rather than a visual resemblance between source files. For the warmup, use the provided ASCII strings and bounded integer cases, including the documented minimum-integer rejection. Record a predicted result, actual result and explanation for each case. Compare returned values rather than incidental collection-printing styles."

					"A signature states the callable name, input types and output type. Python can discover an incompatible argument while executing; Java and C++ reject many incompatible calls during compilation. Read the provided helper declarations before changing a body. A Java `static` method belongs to its class without requiring an instance; a C++ free function is callable outside a class. `boolean`/`bool` represents the membership flag, `double` represents the price, and integer helpers return `int`. Preserve the original names and parameter order so the supplied driver and checks still call the same API. Use the Python baseline to decide the behavior of each input. The signature alone does not decide whether an amount may be negative, which letters count as vowels, or which boundary is inclusive; those promises are in the contract."
				],
				[
					"Void, Value Returns, and Compile-Time Mismatches",
					"A value-returning function must produce its promised type on every reachable path. `void` describes a function with no returned value; it does not match a helper whose caller uses a computed score, price or count. `return` ends the current call, so a branch placed after it will not execute. Before compiling, trace every condition to confirm a result is produced. A missing return or incompatible type is a compiler diagnostic; a wrong clamp boundary can compile and still fail a behavior check. Floating-point arithmetic stores approximations, so compare price results with a small stated tolerance rather than assuming every decimal has an exact representation. The shared price inputs are finite, non-negative doubles. Keep the contract’s domain visible rather than adding unrelated input policies during translation."
				],
				[
					"Reading Compiler Feedback Productively",
					"Compiler errors are structured feedback rather than evidence that the language is hostile. Start at the first error’s file and line, inspect the named expression and the preceding statement, then compare its type or punctuation with the declaration. A missing brace or semicolon can cause many later errors; fix one cause and rebuild before changing unrelated lines. Preserve the diagnostic and explain what changed. After a successful build, run ordinary and boundary cases independently of the demonstration driver. For the function pack, predict scores below/at/above the clamp limits, both membership values, empty text and repeated uppercase/lowercase vowels. Confirm the inputs remain unchanged. During a facilitated walkthrough, explain the failing trace and propose the smallest correction; independent study uses the same prediction-and-check record."

					"Python lists grow dynamically. A Java array has a fixed length after creation and uses `.length`; `ArrayList` grows and uses `.size()`, `.get(index)` and `.add(value)`. A C++ `vector` grows, uses `.size()` and `.push_back(value)`, and provides indexed access or range iteration. The collection pack accepts Java `List<String>` or C++ `const vector<string>&`. Java’s supplied `List.of(...)` is unmodifiable, so build a new result instead of adding to the input. A C++ const reference borrows the vector without copying it and prevents mutation through that reference. The port must preserve input order and duplicates. Draw the input and result as separate collections, then trace which words are retained. A loop that visits each value directly avoids unnecessary index arithmetic."
				],
				[
					"String APIs and Slice Replacement",
					"Python slicing uses an excluded end index. Java `substring(start, end)` also excludes the end; C++ `substr(start, count)` takes a character count instead of an end index. For the first two ASCII characters of `bridge`, Java `substring(0, 2)` and C++ `substr(0, 2)` both produce `br`. For a middle range, convert the Python end into `end - start` for C++. Java strings are immutable, while C++ strings have mutable operations; assigning a new string result is distinct from changing a collection. Java string length counts UTF-16 code units and C++ string size counts bytes. Neither is a general Unicode user-perceived character count. The shared assignment deliberately uses ASCII fixtures. Explain that limit before generalizing the algorithm to names or multilingual text."
				],
				[
					"Bounds and Loop Discipline",
					"Valid indexes run from zero through size minus one. An empty collection has no valid element index, so a loop guard must prevent reading element zero when the size is zero. For an indexed loop, use a strict less-than end condition; a range loop can avoid manual bounds entirely. Before implementing the collection helpers, trace lengths four, five and six to determine the inclusive filter boundary. Trace two equally long words to preserve the first longest match, and retain repeated qualifying words in their original positions. A new result must not alias a mutable input list. Check the original input after calling each helper and test the empty case separately. Compare returned elements, since Java and C++ drivers intentionally print collections differently."

During a session, pause after each loop iteration to predict the partial result; independently, write the same trace before execution.

					"An object combines state with operations that preserve a contract. The account port stores an owner and balance, validates construction, and exposes deposit, withdrawal and summary operations. Draw the balance before and after each call; rejected operations must leave it unchanged. Encapsulation keeps direct balance changes out of callers so the account can enforce its rules consistently. Python, Java and C++ express the same model differently, but validation order and state preservation remain behavior requirements. This teaching example uses finite doubles; production monetary software needs an explicit exact representation. The sample does not establish a production finance design. Start with construction and one valid operation, then rejection cases, before adding formatted output."

					"Java Class Structure",
					"A Java public class belongs in the file matching its name: `BankAccount` in `BankAccount.java`, and the supplied driver `Main` in `Main.java`. A constructor has the class name and no declared return type; `new` constructs an instance. Private fields protect state, while public methods form the callable interface. `this` names the current instance when a field and parameter have the same name. Compile both files together before running `java Main`. Java object variables hold references: assigning `second = first` makes both variables refer to the same account, so a change through one is visible through the other. A separate `new` account has separate state. Explain this with a two-variable diagram and a small prediction before execution."
				],
				[
					"C++ Class Structure and Header/Source Separation",
					"The C++ header declares the class, its fields and public signatures. The implementation `.cpp` defines those methods with `BankAccount::methodName`; the driver `.cpp` calls them. Include the header where its declarations are needed, and compile both source files to provide the method definitions. Compiling only the driver can succeed at syntax checking and fail at linking because definitions are missing. A header guard prevents duplicate declarations within a translation unit. A C++ account variable here holds a value: an ordinary copy creates a separate account whose later balance changes do not change the original. This differs from Java reference assignment. Preserve all imported filenames and the header, use the supplied build command, and avoid adding raw pointers or manual allocation to this exercise."

A null reference names no object, so calling an instance method on null raises a runtime error. If null is allowed by a contract, test it before dereferencing or compare from a known non-null value. The quiz helper’s inputs are explicitly non-null ASCII strings; do not silently invent a null policy. Trimming surrounding whitespace and comparing text are separate operations.
