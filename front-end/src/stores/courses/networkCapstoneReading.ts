The changed-prefix comparison belongs to the required core; this optional task investigates cancellation and recovery.\n\nIn the owned disposable Linux VM, run sudo python3 main.py --hold-after-ready 15 --output ./interruption-observation. In a second terminal in the same role directory, check for ./interruption-observation/ready.json. Once that file exists, press Ctrl+C in the first terminal during the fifteen-second hold. Keep the actual cancellation status and interruption records; an ordinary completed run is not an interruption observation. If the hold ends first, preserve that result separately and use a new output folder for another attempt.\n\nCompare the interrupted run with a normally completed run in another fresh output folder. Reconcile worker termination and reaping, the empty remaining namespace list and the actual parent before/after comparison. Explain why successful HTTP evidence from an earlier run cannot substitute for this cleanup observation. Complete the runbook with the trigger, observed final state, recovery path and one limitation. The optional challenge and reference stay separate from the required core attempt. Extra Python programming is optional."
