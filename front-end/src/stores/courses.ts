Open a new Scratch project. Have your student click on the Events section and look at the broadcast __ and when I receive __ blocks. Explain that broadcasting is a way that sprites can send each other messages to trigger or start certain parts of our code.

It’s dancing time! Let’s give each sprite a turn to “perform” on the stage.

1. When the green flag is clicked, make the ballerina glide to the middle of the stage and cycle twice through all of her costumes. When she’s done, have her glide off to the right side of the stage.
2. One by one, make each of the other dancers do the same thing. Can you add some clapping between each performer? We also need to be sure to make them start back on the left when the green flag is clicked!
3. A dance party isn’t very fun without music! Add some code to the backdrop so that it plays dancing music forever. When Champ is done dancing, broadcast a message that stops the music.
4. Can you make it so that the lights change, too? How about some clapping once everyone is done?

Let’s make a game where you control a bowl and try to collect various items!

1. Start by programming the bowl so that it can be controlled by the arrow keys once the green flag is clicked.
2. When a sprite is touched by the bowl, make it broadcast a message (like “Cheese touched”, for example).
3. Think about what each sprite should do when it receives these messages. Should they move? Make a sound? What should the bowl do?
4. Add variables to your program that keep track of the number of times each object has been collected.
5. Add a timer that stops the game after 15 seconds. When the timer runs out, broadcast a message that makes all sprites on the screen do something (e.g., spin in a circle, grow and shrink, etc.).

**Instructor Note**: As an extension, the student can turn Bowl Fill into a two-player game (e.g., a second bowl controlled with W-A-S-D).

When your student finishes their project, have them make a Recording Studio Video explaining what the project does and how they programmed it. Finally, have them share their project!`

Make sure they can map out the sequence of events (they can even write it in a comment block) before implementing their code!

Design your own play, and use the broadcast blocks to set up the scene changes and dialogue between characters!

1. Come up with a story that involves 3-4 characters and scenes. You can use movies or your real life as inspiration!

Have your student play through the demo and identify the different elements of the game that they will have to program in order to create this game. Helpful questions include: what does each sprite do? How do we control it? How does each sprite react to certain events? What variables do we need to keep track of? How does the game end?

Create a comment in the project to write out the different steps of what we will need to code.

Starter code is provided, but the student is also welcome to create a project from scratch with custom sprites, costumes and backdrops.

**Instructor Note**: The solution provided uses the wait until __ block. Other solutions not using that block may exist, but it shouldn’t be too difficult for the student to pick out this block and incorporate it appropriately.

**Instructor Note**: Ideas for extensions for this game include: adding another button that stops the whole game, adding a timer that shows how long it takes to reach the end and making the hedgehogs customizable by clicking on them to change their color.

The wizard has been turned into a frog! Help him collect potions while avoiding skeletons to turn back into a wizard.

1. Let’s start by working on our frog wizard! Make it so when the green flag is clicked, he goes to the center of the screen, changes his size and moves when the arrow keys are pressed.
2. Next, let’s make the skeleton move! We want the skeleton to go to a random position on the far right side of the screen and constantly move left. When it is touching the frog or the left edge, make it go back to the right side.
3. Now do the same thing to the potion. If you want to make the game more challenging, make the potion wait a few seconds before appearing on the right again. (Hint: you’ll need to use show/hide blocks).
4. Our frog needs to be able to level up and down in order to win or lose the game. Start by making a variable to keep track of the level and set it to 1 when the green flag is clicked.
5. Make message broadcasts for leveling up and down. When they level up, if they are at level 4, they win the game. Otherwise, increase their level by 1, switch the costume and increase the size. When they level down, if they are at level 1, they lose the game. Otherwise, decrease their level by 1, switch the costume and decrease the size.
6. Make sure to broadcast the level-up/level-down messages when the skeletons or potion touch the frog.
7. Feel free to add another skeleton to make the game more difficult.
8. Add sound effects and backdrop changes for the finishing touches!`

						content: `**Instructor Note**: As you’re starting this module, begin thinking about the next course for the student. Juni courses are continuous, meaning you should proceed directly into the next course after the current one is completed. Typically, the student should progress with you into Scratch Level 2, but some students may be ready for Python Level 1 after completing Scratch 1. We typically recommend Scratch Level 2 for students who are interested in building more complex Scratch projects, enjoy custom graphics or don’t yet have the keyboarding skills needed for typing code. If your student is interested in learning text-based programming and has proficient typing skills, they might be ready for Python Level 1!  We look to the instructor to discuss with the student and parent to make a recommendation. When you are ready to move your student into the next course, navigate to your student’s profile, click the edit icon next to their current course and follow the instructions in the modal. If you run into any issues updating the course or have questions about student readiness, reach out to @HQ Support on Slack.

For your Master Project, you now have the skills and knowledge to design and build a game of your own! Spend some time brainstorming what kind of game the student would like to make, thinking about the past projects we have created and different elements we’d like to incorporate.

**Instructor Note**: In general, the Master Project should span the course of approximately two weeks, with the student making significant progress on the project for homework each week. Please keep this in mind when scoping the project with the student. If the student wishes to continue working on additional features after this timeframe, they are welcome to continue asking you questions during the 5-10 minutes at the end of each class while you move on to the next course. If you feel there are special circumstances where this two-week timeframe should not apply (e.g., a parent requests a more complex project), please speak with Juni HQ.

Once the student has an idea, discuss the plan for programming the game. Helpful questions include: what does each sprite do? How do we control it? How does each sprite react to certain events? What variables do we need to keep track of? How does the game end?`

They should try to touch on all of the concepts from this course they used to build their game. Optionally, they can also bring a family member to class to present their project.

Encourage your student to publish their project using their Learner Portal (click the Share button at the bottom right corner of the project) and share the link with their friends and family! You can also nominate the project for Juni Project of the Month.

Another way the student can celebrate their project is by hosting a Juni Party! The student can invite their friends to a special Juni Party, where they show off their Master Project and code with their friends. Ask your student if this is something they would be interested in, and add the link https://start.junilearning.com/juniparty to your session notes so students and parents can learn more about this free offering to Juni students!`

If the student hasn’t thought of them, make sure they include conditionals, XY coordinates, variables, event listeners and loops in their list.

Discuss with the student their next course: Scratch Level 2 or Python Level 1. If your student is taking Scratch Level 2 as their next course, proceed directly into Scratch Level 2 by following the instructions in the Instructor Note at the top of this page. If your student is taking Python Level 1, proceed with the Optional Extra Practice activity below.`

						title: "Optional Extra Practice – Typing Games",
						content: `This optional section is for students transitioning from Scratch Level 1 into Python Level 1.

The purpose of this section is to prepare students to transition from block-based to text-based coding and to assess their typing and computer literacy skills. If your student is advanced, has strong typing skills or is not taking a text-based programming language as their next course, you may skip this activity at your discretion. These typing games are optional and students don’t need to play all of them. Encourage your student to choose games that are interesting to them and move on once the student has practiced for 15-20 minutes or if the student is already a strong typist. Feel free to skip to the intermediate typing games if your student is older than 6.

One of the biggest differences between Python and Scratch is that we’ll need to type our code out rather than using blocks. Let’s play a few games to practice typing as we prepare ourselves to write Python code.

Beginner Typing Games:
•  Practice with the Keyboard – Typing Letters: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/214833806/
•  Practice with the Keyboard – Typing Numbers: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/214828609/
•  Practice with the Keyboard – Typing Letters Race: https://www.nitrotype.com/

Intermediate Typing Games:
•  Cup Stack Typing: https://www.abcya.com/games/cup-stack-typing-game
•  Ghost Typing: https://www.abcya.com/games/ghost_typing
•  Koala Paddleboards (spelling and typing practice): https://www.abcya.com/games/spelling_practice

Advanced Typing Games:

Have your student play through the demo and identify the different elements of the game that they will have to program in order to create this game. Helpful questions include: what does each sprite do? How do we control it? How does each sprite react to certain events? What variables do we need to keep track of? How does the game end?

Create a comment in the project to write out the different steps of what we will need to code.

Starter code is provided, but the student is also welcome to create a project from scratch with custom sprites, costumes and backdrops.

A tricky part of this project is that the size block only changes the size of the sprite that uses it. We want the size of all the fish to change over time! We’ll need to keep track of each fish’s size using a variable. Alternatively, you can access another sprite’s size through the sensing block [size of] of [sprite] and save the size there.

The final sizes: 20–40 (Guppy), 40–80 (Goldfish), 80–120 (Flounder), 120–160 (Barracuda), 160–200 (Bluefin Tuna), >200 (Blue Whale).

When your student finishes their project, have them make a Recording Studio Video explaining what the project does and how they programmed it. Finally, have them share their project!`

**Instructor Note**: In general, the Master Project should span the course of approximately two weeks, with the student making significant progress on the progress for homework each week. Please keep this in mind when scoping the project with the student. If the student wishes to continue working on additional features after this timeframe, they are welcome to continue asking you questions during the 5-10 minutes at the end of each class, while you move onto the next course. If you feel there are special circumstances where this two-week timeframe should not apply (e.g. parent is requesting student to work on a more complex project), please speak with Juni HQ.

If the student hasn’t thought of them, make sure they include conditionals, XY coordinates, variables, event listeners, loops, and functions in their list.

Great job! Many of these concepts that we’ve learned in Scratch we are going to use in Python as well. Let's take a closer look at our next course.

Discuss with the student their next course: Python Level 1. In Python Level 1, we will learn our first programming language that requires us to fully type out our code instead of using blocks! However, we are going to use a lot of the same concepts we've already become comfortable with in Scratch.`

						title: "Optional Extra Practice: Typing Games",
						content: `This is an optional section for students transitioning from Scratch into Python Level 1.

The purpose of this section is to prepare students to transition from block based to text based coding and to assess their typing and computer literacy skills.

If your student is advanced, has strong typing skills, or is not taking a text based programming language as their next course, you may skip this activity at your discretion.

These typing games are optional and students don’t need to play all of them. Encourage your student to choose games that are interesting to them and move on once the student has practiced for 15-20 minutes, or if the student is already a strong typist.

Feel free to skip to the intermediate typing games if your student is older than 6.

One of the biggest differences between Python and Scratch is that we’ll need to type our code out rather than using blocks. Let’s play a few games to practice typing as we prepare ourselves to write Python code.

Beginner Typing Games:
- Practice with the Keyboard - Typing Letters: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/214833806/ — Try to reach 10 points!
- Practice with the Keyboard - Typing Numbers: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/214828609/ — Try to reach 10 points!
- Practice with the Keyboard - Typing Letters Race: https://www.nitrotype.com/ — See if you can type letters faster than your opponent and win the race.

Intermediate Typing Games:
- Cup Stack Typing: https://www.abcya.com/games/cup-stack-typing-game
- Ghost Typing: https://www.abcya.com/games/ghost_typing
- Koala Paddleboards (spelling and typing practice): https://www.abcya.com/games/spelling_practice

Advanced Typing Games:
- Typing Rocket: https://www.abcya.com/games/typing_rocket
- Type Racer: https://replit.com/@JuniLearning/PS12-Type-Racer?v=1

Assuming you have followed the Instructor Note at the beginning of this module, feel free to proceed directly into the student's next course after this activity.

**Instructor Note**: If your student is still developing their typing skills, it can be helpful to start their Python classes with a “warmup” of five minutes working on these typing games.`

		Pointers allow us to store memory addresses of variables. Every variable has a memory address, which we can obtain using the \`&\` operator. A pointer is declared by placing \`*\` after the type (e.g., \`int* p1\`), and we assign it the address of a variable using \`&\`. A pointer’s type must match the type of the variable it points to.

		• If we have a pointer \`p1\` that points to \`int val = 5\`, what happens when we print \`*p1\`? **Answer:** It prints the value of \`val\`.
		• What happens when we print \`p1\` without dereferencing it? **Answer:** It prints the address that the pointer points to.
		• What happens when we change the value of \`*p1\`? **Answer:** The value of the variable that \`p1\` points to will be changed.
		• If we set a new pointer equal to an existing one, what does the new pointer store? **Answer:** It stores the same address that the first pointer stores.
		• Assume two pointers \`p1\` and \`p2\` where \`p2 = p1\`. What happens when we change \`*p2\`? **Answer:** We change the value that both pointers are pointing to.
		• What happens when we try to dereference an uninitialized pointer? **Answer:** It’s undefined behavior and unpredictable.
		• What happens when we try to dereference a pointer that is \`nullptr\`? **Answer:** Most compilers will throw an error.
		• Would \`*p1 = &val\` work? **Answer:** No, it would set the dereferenced value to the address of \`val\`, which is incorrect.
		• Would \`*p1 = val\` work? **Answer:** It sets the value pointed to by \`p1\` equal to the value of \`val\`, not the address.
		• Would \`p1 = val\` work? **Answer:** No; it attempts to assign the literal value of \`val\` (not its address) to \`p1\`.

If we keep appending data past the array’s end without checking capacity, we could overwrite memory we don’t own. To create dynamic arrays: (1) declare a pointer to the array; (2) create the array with \`new\`; (3) use the pointer as the array; (4) if we run out of space, allocate a new (larger) array, copy over the elements and delete the old one; (5) remember to free memory with \`delete\` when done.`

		title: "Dynamic Arrays and Memory",
		content: `A dynamic array automatically resizes itself when it runs out of room. We’ll write our own \`DynamicArray\` class that creates a new array with more space when the old one runs out, copies old values to the new array and deletes the old one. Failing to call \`delete\` can cause memory leaks. When a class allocates memory, write a destructor (prefixed with \`~\`) that frees that memory. Destructors are called automatically when the object goes out of scope.`

		• A default constructor that sets \`mysize\` to 0, \`maxSize\` to a default size and \`myVals\` to a new array of that size.
		• A destructor that deletes \`myVals\` and sets \`mysize\` to 0.
		• \`addVal(int val)\`: check if there’s enough space; if not, create a new array with double the previous capacity, copy values over, swap pointers (e.g., using \`std::swap(myVals, temp)\`), delete the old array and then add the new value. Increment \`mysize\`.
		• \`printVals()\`: print out the values stored, iterating over \`myVals\` based on \`mysize\`.
		• \`get(int index)\`: return the value at a specific index.

Structs are useful for grouping small, related data items (e.g., a \`node\` struct with \`int data\` and \`node* next\`). They appear often in code because they’re concise. In the next project we’ll create a Grocery List using structs to combine item names and prices.`

Because groceries contain just a name and a price, create a simple \`struct\` in the \`DynamicArray.h\` file. Include a basic constructor and an all‑members constructor to initialize its private variables. Modify the dynamic array to store this struct instead of \`int\`; update any functions that depend on the array’s data type. Desired functionality: printing the list and adding an item. To remove an item at an index, shift elements by copying into a new array and skipping the removed item (ensure the \`Grocery\` item being added is newly constructed to avoid pass‑by‑value errors). Create a basic menu that lets the user add, remove, print and quit. When finished, record a video explaining what the project does and how it was programmed, then share it.`,

		title: "CPPF10 Master Project: Matrix Fun",
		content: `**Instructor Note**: This project requires the student to understand what matrices are. Though the student may not have seen this concept in their math classes, make sure to explain matrices at a basic level to your student.
		
		• We can call grids of numbers matrices.
		• There’s a lot of operations we can do with matrices such as addition. Show the student how to complete matrix addition.
		
		It’s important to remember that two matrices need to have the same dimension for us to do matrix addition.
		
		Show the student what we’re trying to create and have them map out the process they would take to make this matrix addition possible.
		
		Create variables for the number of rows, columns, and for each of the matrices. We can either initialize our matrices to be very large (for example, we could make them 100×100 even though we probably won’t use all of the slots), or we could just initialize the matrices after the user has entered the dimensions. It may also be helpful to create a matrix to store our result!
		
		Ask the user for the dimensions of the matrix.
		
		Ask the user for the elements of the matrix. (Hint: use loops!)
		
		Add the matrices and print out the result in a grid layout (i.e., each row is printed on a different line).
		
		When your student finishes their project, have them make a Recording Studio Video where they explain what the project does and how they programmed it. Finally, have them share their project!`,

		{
		title: "CPPF11 Master Project: Profile Posts",
		content: `Create a Profile class that stores posts that have a caption and a number of hearts on them. The user can then add posts to their profile, and print out the posts’ captions and the total number of hearts on all of the posts.
		
		**Instructor Note**: Brainstorm with your student the different pieces of data that need to be stored, and how those pieces of data are related to each other.
		
		Post struct: a Post stores a caption as a string, and a number of hearts as an integer. Optionally, since the number of hearts will never be negative, we could use \`size_t\` to store the number of hearts.
		
		The Profile class needs to store a changing amount of Post structs: we need to be able to add more Posts as necessary. We can write the Profile class to be very similar to the DynamicArray class, since we need to be able to store and add a changing amount of information.
		
		Variables:
		• \`numPosts\`: current number of stored posts.
		• \`maxSize\`: maximum capacity of stored posts.
		• \`myPosts\`: dynamic array of posts.
		
		\`addPost(newPost)\`: Just like how we defined the dynamic array, this function should dynamically resize our posts array if we are out of room. Otherwise, we can add it at the next available position normally according to \`mySize\`. Note: don’t forget to increment \`mySize\`; otherwise, it is much more difficult to keep track of the next available slot to put data.
		
		\`printPost(index)\`: given an index, prints out a post’s caption and the number of hearts it has.
		
		\`printPosts()\`: iterates through all of the posts that are stored in the \`myPosts\` array and prints out their caption and hearts.
		
		\`addHearts(index, numHearts)\`: adds hearts to the post at the specified index.
		
		**Instructor Note**: Since multiple functions will require us to validate if an index given to a function actually corresponds to a post in the array, we should use a helper function to reuse the logic. This function could be named something such as \`validPostIndex(index)\`, and could return a boolean that indicates whether the given index is valid or not.
		
		**Bonus Extensions**
		• Add other fields to your posts that are printed out when \`printPost\` is called. Other fields could include the date it was posted, the location the image was taken, and comments.
		• Create a \`sumHearts()\` function that returns the total of all the hearts on all of the posts.
		• Add other functions that allow you to further edit posts. For example, you could make it possible to edit a caption, remove the post altogether, etc.
		• Create a function that will duplicate the last existing post in your profile until the current capacity is reached. **Note**: This is implemented in the \`fillPosts\` function in the solution code.
		
		When your student finishes their project, have them make a Recording Studio Video where they explain what the project does and how they programmed it. Finally, have them share their project!`,
