# Course audit progress

## Scope and evidence boundary

The audit covers course availability, distinct delivery purposes, self-contained
student reading and instructor walkthroughs, neutral copy, core and supplemental
project placement, accurate starter/solution source, confirmed IDE imports, Juni
source fidelity, and transcript-backed teaching requirements. It remains active;
a passing catalog test is not proof that every source pack is complete.

The 2026-10-04 availability sweep used the normalized catalog at `v2.8.15`:

- All 77 catalog entries loaded successfully.
- Every directly attached `/course-assets/` project, solution, dataset, and media
  path had a corresponding file in `front-end/public`.
- This was a local source check, not an HTTP check of every external resource,
  an inline-Markdown link audit, or a production deployment check.

## Starter-import corrections

Previously, linked starter failures could fall through to a generic demo carrying
the requested project's title and source metadata. README-only starters could
also create projects without runnable source. Imports reused the read-only
preview, which intentionally cuts text at 80,000 characters and limits directory
traversal. The language bridge selected Python mode for Java source.

The corrected workflow:

- Requires explicit import confirmation and does not execute imported code.
- Imports full eligible text within the existing 120,000-byte file limit.
- Rejects oversized files, more than 80 eligible files, excessive folder depth,
  and linked-source entries rather than silently importing a partial list.
- Keeps preview caches separate from fresh import reads.
- Rejects missing source for the selected runtime and propagates download errors
  without creating a replacement demo or overwriting existing learner work.
- Shows the failure beside the confirmation controls, including empty accounts
  that do not yet have a console. Retrying downloads the requested source again.
- Opens bridge Java starters in Java mode and C++ starters in a source workspace.
  The C++ workspace imports sources and headers after confirmation, saves and
  downloads the full project, and supplies native C++17 build instructions.
  C++ compilation and execution use the documented local compiler workflow.
  This does not add a C++ browser compiler or certify the unfinished BRG packs.
- Gives the ZIP import control an accessible name and uses theme-aware readable
  text for the import source URL, addressing browser-discovered label and dark
  contrast failures.

No dependencies, lockfiles, saved projects, course identifiers, or progress keys
were changed. Existing learner projects are not automatically rewritten.

## Source-pack reconciliation and corrections

An untruncated public tree at Python Level 3 source revision
`d3610afbe355ce2ab3fa6747ef438bce2c83c3be` confirmed the local finding: 44 linked
starter folders, eleven with Python code and 33 structural placeholders.

[Source PR #1](https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-3/pull/1)
provided six incomplete algorithm starters and fixed large-integer binary
conversion. Its integrated source was `9293c232ec7d8b318956df516836d7d4d4d04449`.

[Source PR #2](https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-3/pull/2)
at integrated source `f9b62f604a0429a7081e94cff7a3c9769dd9dc7d` provides nine more
incomplete console/recursion starters, fourteen supplied function-analysis
examples without answer comments, and a complete ten-prompt mathematical
worksheet with a separate reference key. All 22 source tests passed locally
and in hosted CI. The first check-in practice remains core; AM5's extra list
and substring practice remains supplemental.

Reference corrections cover empty inputs, literal/case-sensitive palindromes,
bracket-only validation, negative maxima, stable contiguous substrings, exact
and blank assistant commands, per-session name state, and case-insensitive
language rules with specific failure messages. The site text states these
contracts. Coding imports still require confirmation and do not execute source.

Big-O analysis is a mathematical worksheet, so it keeps its readable source
and reference links without misleading code-preview or IDE-import controls.
Its verification evidence is worksheet-specific, not a coding implementation.
Function Analysis
does supply code and retains its Python import shortcut. A Python-file count is
not a correctness or readiness gate for a non-coding assignment.

[Source PR #3](https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-3/pull/3)
adds six incomplete sorting starters with explicit new-list, in-place and
consuming contracts. References fix selection's suffix scan and tied-record
identity, use stable indexed merging, handle empty/singleton lists consistently,
and no longer run demonstrations or experiments during import. Sorting Comparison
remains core and reports only measured medians on fresh copies of shared, seeded
inputs after correctness checks. It excludes preparation, copying, validation
and printing from timings. All 31 source tests and the eight focused site-flow
tests passed locally; full site CI remains the delivery authority.

Ten structural placeholder roles remain open. A separate bounded review of the
eleven distinct migrated pairs found seven concrete prompt/reference mismatches,
including inexact Hailstone arithmetic, a ten-versus-twenty list count, tied-mode
ordering, a missing first-one search, a missing sorted experiment shape, absent
bubble-sort early exit, and a broken optional punctuation extension. These are
recorded follow-ups, not repairs delivered by the sorting milestone. Additional
input-domain, file-format and mutation contracts need assignment-specific review.
Those seven findings were open at the sorting milestone. The fundamentals,
check-in and record/file follow-ups below repair all seven. This closes those
specific mismatches, not the ten remaining placeholders or the broader audit.

[Source PR #4](https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-3/pull/4)
at integrated source `6ed2caf76313b92163e3c450f6bd7192e518b9a5` repairs AM2
Functions Practice, AM2 Lists Practice and the AM3 Fundamentals Problem Set.
Thirty-two callable starter functions remain intentionally incomplete, with
separate reference implementations and complete learner briefs. The five
required iterative function exercises remain distinct from their two optional
challenges and the later recursion projects.

References use exact integer Hailstone and digit arithmetic, produce twenty
positive evens, and return tied modes in ascending order. Domain, case, empty-list,
fresh-output and mutation rules are explicit. Hailstone has a transition cap;
bounded examples do not prove general convergence. All sixteen fundamentals
prompts are available in the site and starter brief without requiring reference
answers. Normalized learner copy retains these full prompts and existing progress
IDs, and corrects the article when replacing instructor with course facilitator.

All 45 source tests passed locally and in exact-head hosted CI. Focused site
regressions check the complete normalized instructions and confirmed-import
workflow; full site CI remains the delivery authority. At that milestone, twenty-four authored
coding pairs, one supplied-code analysis and one worksheet are checked. Eight
distinct migrated pairs and ten coding placeholder roles still awaited verification.
The source repository's
[review ledger](https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-3/blob/6ed2caf76313b92163e3c450f6bd7192e518b9a5/SOURCE_PACK_REVIEW.md)
distinguishes those boundaries. Do not copy completed answers into coding starters
or certify a nonempty folder as an implementation pair.

[Source PR #5](https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-3/pull/5)
at integrated source `2a5f8d3ef1c7ec91e98219c399c849d2528edcb5` completes five
check-in/review packs with 27 incomplete callable tasks and complete briefs.
Five original supplied problem functions remain tracing/optimization inputs,
checked against their frozen source fixture; reference answers stay separate.
All 63 source methods passed locally and hosted. The matching site change
[PR #124](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/pull/124)
passed full reviewed-head and independent integrated-main CI, including real
confirmed Python import, execution, generated output reopening, exact-byte ZIP
export and saved-workspace reopening with production/API writes blocked.
The CI-attested native files are retained unchanged in the published
[v2.8.25](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/releases/tag/v2.8.25).
Production activation remains separate and unverified.

[Source PR #6](https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-3/pull/6)
at integrated source `6b7ed239bf995cc0725e71850ba6c8b83bb0629d` completes the
last three migrated pairs: Baseball Analytics, File IO and Dictionaries, and
Juni Latin with File IO. Three complete learner briefs accompany twelve matching
incomplete callable tasks, including one explicitly optional punctuation helper.

Baseball uses exact statistic keys, validated synthetic records, fresh stable
descending rankings and unchanged inputs. Dictionary reading defines surrounding
whitespace, blank/odd/duplicate policies without inventing output writing. The
translator preserves the original character-to-end-plus-ay rule and literal case,
states deliberate whitespace/line changes and keeps punctuation separately
selected. File validation and reading precede output opening; identical paths,
symlink/hardlink aliases and malformed input cannot silently overwrite source.

All 80 source methods passed locally and in exact-head
[push CI](https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-3/actions/runs/37258197420)
and [review CI](https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-3/actions/runs/37258200108),
then independently on [integrated main](https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-3/actions/runs/37258283220).
Independent bounded oracles check rankings, dictionary pairs and character
translation. Original player records and all six Git input blobs match the
pre-change source byte-for-byte. Exact fixtures recognize baseline LF bytes and
the Mac's configured CRLF checkout variants, without arbitrary normalization.
The first Linux run exposed that checkout difference and was corrected against
the original Git blobs; input files and Git attributes were not changed.

The matching site briefs state every function/domain/file rule, retain titles,
core placement and progress IDs, and separate learner/reference source roles.
The AM7 explanation also distinguishes logarithmic binary-search comparisons
and index-bound runtime from the original sliced reference's linear worst-case
copying work. Full site verification for this new group is pending; the existing
v2.8.25 workflow evidence is not substituted for its own checks.

That group subsequently passed full reviewed-head and independent integrated-main
site CI. Its unchanged CI-attested native artifacts are retained in the published
[v2.8.26](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/releases/tag/v2.8.26).
Production activation remains separate and unverified.

Thirty-two authored coding/review pairs, one supplied-code analysis and one
worksheet are checked; no distinct migrated pair remains open. Ten genuine
coding placeholder roles and other-course purpose, source and workflow audits
remain incomplete. Current source boundaries are recorded in the
[review ledger](https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-3/blob/6b7ed239bf995cc0725e71850ba6c8b83bb0629d/SOURCE_PACK_REVIEW.md).

Additional source/language alignment checks remain necessary for generated
bridge extension packs. Several local folders titled as C++ practice contained
Java starters; selecting a working Java runtime does not resolve that coursework
content mismatch.

## Interactive search follow-up

[Source PR #7](https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-3/pull/7)
at integrated source `2473272796d28401c2b8a3f50b472070d9272e3a` completes three
genuine coding placeholders: Reverse Number Guesser, Number Guesser and Runtime
Comparator. Thirteen matching incomplete callables accompany complete learner
briefs; the sliced recursive-search helper is explicitly optional. Completed
reference answers stay separate. Original commands, folder names, 1–100 domains,
seven-try defaults and search parameter names remain.

Computer-led guessing now distinguishes confirmed, conditionally inferred,
contradictory, exhausted and cancelled outcomes. Invalid responses retry without
consuming attempts. The supplemental player-led random-secret game validates
ASCII integer text and accepted attempts, supports injected secrets and does not
claim seven arbitrary guesses guarantee a win. These distinct purposes remain
required and optional respectively; the search experiment remains required.

The experiment uses a shared multiset/query batch, independently checked untimed
warm-ups, fresh copies and measured full-batch medians. Preparation, sorting,
oracle work, validation and printing are not timed. Original-order versus sorted
hit positions are disclosed as a confound; timings do not prove Big-O or include
the end-to-end preparation cost. Workloads and repeat counts are bounded.

All 101 native source methods passed locally, in exact-head
[push CI](https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-3/actions/runs/37263130709)
and [review CI](https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-3/actions/runs/37263164387),
then on independent [integrated main](https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-3/actions/runs/37263245237).
Tests cover every default secret, exhaustive small-list membership, invalid and
terminal states, quiet imports, original incomplete signatures, real guarded
default runs, independent clocks, timer boundaries and mutation/result failures.
The optional guarded Ruff preflight refused audited-version drift; its policy
was unchanged, and the canonical native source gate passed.

Matching site briefs retain titles, progress IDs and the 86-core/4-optional
inventory. That group passed full
[reviewed-head CI](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/actions/runs/37263916323)
and independent
[integrated-main CI](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/actions/runs/37264361642).
Its exact tagged
[native build and attestation](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/actions/runs/37264829763)
produced the unchanged authenticated assets published in
[v2.8.27](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/releases/tag/v2.8.27).
Downstream [PR #17](https://github.com/instruction-material/classes.jacobdanderson.net/pull/17)
and independent [fork-main CI](https://github.com/instruction-material/classes.jacobdanderson.net/actions/runs/37265017700)
passed after preserving the neutral instructor overlay. Production activation
remains separate and unverified. Thirty-five authored coding/review pairs, one
supplied-code analysis and one worksheet are checked. Seven genuine coding
placeholders and the broader course/purpose/source/workflow audit remained open.

## Crazy Name Tags follow-up

[Source PR #8](https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-3/pull/8)
at integrated source `efd0cdfb190a9110ec1a160786e13f724a60153f` replaces the
structural Name Tags starter with a full learner brief, four incomplete core
callables and one optional separate-file callable. The single-file project
remains required; it teaches transformation, exact formatting and deliberate
writing before dictionary parsing and the translator's read/transform/write
pipeline. Titles, existing progress IDs and the 86-core/4-optional inventory remain.

The original literal character orders and extra LF after each core section are
preserved. Empty names give exactly three LFs. Case, spaces/tabs and Unicode code
points are literal; grapheme-aware reversal is not claimed. Reference imports
no longer prompt or truncate output. Validation precedes opening; actual writes
use UTF-8/LF and context-managed closure. Console results distinguish written,
invalid, failed and cancelled states. Optional three-file output has no section
separators, rejects aliases before writing and does not promise rollback after
an ordinary later I/O failure. All four historical sample blobs remain unchanged;
the empty core sample is not misrepresented as a new expected output.

All 118 native source methods pass locally, in exact-head
[push CI](https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-3/actions/runs/37301232728)
and [review CI](https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-3/actions/runs/37301281776),
then independent [integrated-main CI](https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-3/actions/runs/37301369734).
Seventeen new methods use independent bounded character/index oracles and real
temporary-file/console workflows. The optional guarded Ruff and Oxlint preflights
refused audited-version drift; their policy remains unchanged.

Matching site copy now states the full core and optional contracts. The native
browser regression imports the exact immutable incomplete starter and complete
README after confirmation, exercises initial Run, then edits the scaffold for a
valid Unicode-name path, supplies console input, checks generated LF/UTF-8
output, reopens it, captures the real UI ZIP download and reopens saved work.
These test-only edits verify the workflow; independent source checks verify
reference correctness. Production/API writes remain blocked. Site reviewed-head
[CI](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/actions/runs/37302611757)
and independent integrated-main
[CI](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/actions/runs/37303337648)
passed. The exact tagged native build and attestation
[run](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/actions/runs/37304026563)
produced the unchanged assets retained in the published
[v2.8.28](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/releases/tag/v2.8.28).
Downstream [PR #18](https://github.com/instruction-material/classes.jacobdanderson.net/pull/18)
and independent fork-main
[CI](https://github.com/instruction-material/classes.jacobdanderson.net/actions/runs/37304570527)
passed. Production activation remains unverified.
Thirty-six authored coding/review pairs were checked; six coding
placeholders and the full course/purpose/source/workflow audit remain open.

## Conway simulation and ownership follow-up

[Source PR #9](https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-3/pull/9)
integrated at `5e32ed800087ac4d9b0a45d28a3e815e28d58a24` supplies complete
briefs, 24 matching incomplete callable tasks and all ten unchanged original
pattern inputs. Both projects remain required: synchronous Boolean simulation
first, then owned legal turns and strategy. Existing titles, progress IDs and
the 86-core/4-optional inventory remain unchanged.

References use finite nonwrapping B3/S23 and fresh generations. Owned survivors
retain their owner, births use majority, edits precede generation and O/X turns
alternate independently of counts. Paired grow-dead/kill-opponent choices validate
before mutation. Initial/post-edit/post-generation extinction, invalid retries,
full-board passes, cancellation and bounded limits are explicit. Continuous modes
remain selectable without a promise of natural termination. Legacy filenames
resolve their own canonical sibling rather than running conflicting references.

All 144 source methods pass locally and in exact-head
[push CI](https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-3/actions/runs/37309223318),
[review CI](https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-3/actions/runs/37309230627)
and independent integrated-main
[CI](https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-3/actions/runs/37309325600).
Twenty-six new methods use independent exhaustive small-board rule oracles,
fresh-row/domain checks and actual file/console tests. Frozen LF and configured
CRLF input digests allow shallow checkouts without weakening byte preservation.
Optional guarded Ruff/Oxlint refused version drift; approved policy is unchanged.

The site previously filtered out `.in` inputs. Import eligibility, filename/text
handling, upload selection, user/course-code account saving and runtime capture
now retain them, including record
line endings during capture. Full learner contracts are readable in the course.
Native browser coverage uses immutable checked starter/README/input bytes,
requires confirmation, runs the initial reminder, makes test-only valid-path
edits, reads original patterns and console moves, executes a generation, exports
the actual UI ZIP and reopens saved files. A generated `.in` probe exercises
runtime capture. These workflow edits do not replace independent reference tests.
Production/API writes are blocked. Thirty-one focused front-end methods and 341
back-end methods pass locally (one existing back-end test is conditionally
skipped). API fixtures verify actual accepted payloads and unchanged input
records for both account roles while retaining path restrictions. The first
local API run could not bind its isolated loopback servers in the sandbox;
the authorized rerun passed without changing tests. Another 170 IDE/sandbox
methods and the focused catalog-copy gate pass locally. Full hosted checks
exposed a missed plain-worker capture whitelist and a course-copy artifact;
both are corrected. The added regression executes each runtime's actual embedded
Python capture code against temporary CRLF, unterminated, empty and invalid-UTF-8
patterns. Full reviewed-head and independent integrated-main site CI passed,
including both actual Conway import/run/export/reopen workflows. The exact tagged
native build and attestation
[run](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/actions/runs/37314047353)
produced the unchanged assets retained in the published
[v2.8.29](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/releases/tag/v2.8.29).
Every payload digest and thirteen trusted source files were independently checked
without extracting a second dependency tree. Downstream
[PR #19](https://github.com/instruction-material/classes.jacobdanderson.net/pull/19)
and independent fork-main CI passed. Production activation remains unverified.

Thirty-eight authored coding/review pairs, one supplied-code analysis and one
worksheet are checked. Four Tic Tac Toe coding placeholders and the broader
course purpose/source/workflow audit remain open. No live activation is claimed.

## Tic Tac Toe interface, tactics, evaluation and forks

[Source PR #10](https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-3/pull/10)
integrated at `94ddb35a81a5f768ef0a44d91e107cf1b4e66cf5` completes the last four
Python Level 3 coding placeholders. Complete neutral briefs accompany 59 matching
incomplete public callables. Separate references preserve the four original
purposes: playable random-opponent console UI, basic copied-board tactics,
reproducible random-opponent evaluation, and fork creation/defense. All four were
numbered core projects in the original source curriculum and remain required.
Titles, progress IDs and the 86-core/4-optional inventory are unchanged.

References validate board/cell/coordinate domains, copy caller-owned state,
select from finite legal moves, stop on terminal states, retry invalid human
input without advancing, and distinguish cancellation from wins/draws. Imports
are quiet. Evaluation records the seed, start order, counts, fractional rates and
first X-win trace, handles zero games, and isolates strategy callback boards.
Sampled results do not establish optimality.

Forks count distinct future winning coordinates rather than lines through one
square. Multiple-fork defense checks the compulsory reply instead of blindly
selecting a side. Independent game-tree enumeration from empty boards covers both
acting marks, both starts, every legal opponent response and every possible
random fallback. It exposes a basic-policy loss when playing second and finds no
loss for the revised fork reference in that defined scope. This does not certify
unverified learner implementations or arbitrary already-lost positions.

All 167 native source methods pass locally, in exact-head
[push CI](https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-3/actions/runs/37319371632)
and [review CI](https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-3/actions/runs/37319383831),
then independent
[integrated-main CI](https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-3/actions/runs/37319671291).
Twenty-three new methods include independent bitmask checks over all 19,683
symbol boards, 10,956 reachable board/turn states across both starts, complete
policy trees and real console/batch tests. Every active Python Level 3 pack now
has its assignment-specific source review: 42 authored coding/review pairs, one
supplied-code analysis and one worksheet, with zero coding placeholders.
The broader course audit remains open.

The matching site briefs state all required contracts. Browser coverage imports
the exact immutable incomplete starter and README after confirmation, runs the
initial reminder, makes test-only valid-path edits, executes three full console
games and a seeded evaluation batch, captures the actual UI ZIP, and reopens the
saved exact source. These edits exercise the workflow; independent native tests
verify reference correctness. Production/API writes are blocked. All 32 focused
site checks and root source lint pass locally. Full reviewed-head
[site CI](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/actions/runs/37323755593)
and independent
[integrated-main CI](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/actions/runs/37324809996)
passed, including all four actual Tic Tac Toe workflows, 1,300 core and 267
course-quality checks, 301 API checks with 41 existing database-dependent skips,
and eleven Cypress checks. Retained import screenshots were visually inspected.
The exact annotated `v2.8.30` tag targets
`a7d78580d00f8719b3437b0bbb663cb9e03edea9`; its native
[build and attestation](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/actions/runs/37325707003)
passed. Independent proof verification pins repository, workflow, source/signer
commit, tag and hosted runners. Every one of 7,843 archive payload digests and
thirteen trusted source files matches, with safe unique entries and one verified
prior-file hardlink. The original archive, manifest and bundle are retained in
the published
[v2.8.30](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/releases/tag/v2.8.30).
Uploaded and published asset sizes/digests, notes, annotated tag and exact source
were checked. No local rebuild or production activation is claimed.

Downstream [PR #20](https://github.com/instruction-material/classes.jacobdanderson.net/pull/20)
preserves the exact existing 75-file neutral overlay on that canonical commit.
Full reviewed-head checks and independent
[fork-main CI](https://github.com/instruction-material/classes.jacobdanderson.net/actions/runs/37326301345)
passed, including all four browser workflows. Publication used the exact observed
main lease. No downstream tags, releases or deployments were changed.

The stale Python Level 3 ledger also listed two retired Java catalog IDs.
[Source PR #11](https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-3/pull/11)
corrects only that ledger at integrated source
`12ce8ebe9ccdc6fac56a287bc4993380688900a3`, preserving coursework bytes and the
native verification gate. Exact-head push/review checks and independent
[source-main CI](https://github.com/instruction-material/Python-Level-3/actions/runs/37326393287)
passed all 167 methods. Current Java Level 1/2/3 mappings use their own source
repositories; historical archived Java material does not establish Python parity.

## Artifact retention and GitHub release locking

The repository policy requires preserving published tags and artifact bytes.
That retention policy must be distinguished from GitHub's platform-enforced
immutability flag. Final API readback on 2026-10-05 showed `immutable: false` for
v2.8.29 and v2.8.30 despite their checked source and signed provenance. Prior
wording that called those releases immutable was too strong.

GitHub release immutability was disabled for this canonical repository. It is
now enabled for future releases, with an authenticated API readback confirming
the setting. GitHub documents that this protection
[applies to future releases](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/how-tos/secure-your-supply-chain/establish-provenance-and-integrity/prevent-release-changes).
Existing published tags/assets were not replaced, moved or republished to
manufacture a lock. v2.8.30 remains published with matching checked bytes and
signed build provenance, but its GitHub immutability flag remains false. Future
release delivery must verify the enabled policy before publication and confirm
the individual release lock afterward. Live application activation remains a
separate, unverified boundary.

## C++ input foundations and native workspace workflow

[Site PR #133](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/pull/133)
integrated at `e51ad398f74545058f396165d682ffcb85f4a4af`, with a tree identical
to reviewed head `70d99e122aac8b85eb333249c2d6ad8516fefd6d`. It provides the
original five required input/loop projects as incomplete starters with separate
references and complete briefs, preserving lesson order and progress aliases.
The displayed lessons retain all four complete code examples.

The actual saved project key includes a colon after the course ID. Its native
instruction lookup now recognizes that format and displays C++20 for Level 1,
with similar non-Level-1 names excluded. Learner exports retain the documented
warning flags; supplied examples and reviewed references use warnings as errors.
Full [reviewed-head CI](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/actions/runs/37372837436)
and CodeQL passed, including twelve bridge/foundation confirmation, editing,
saving, exact export, reopening and native compilation workflows and all four
lesson console fixtures. Mad Libs and Chat Bot mobile screenshots and the Number
Games desktop workspace were visually inspected. Qodana skipped its unconfigured
scan; that workflow success is not an analysis result. Independent integrated-main
checks, release provenance and downstream delivery remain separate gates.

## C++ functions, probability and guessing contracts

[Source PR #3](https://github.com/instruction-material/CPP-Level-1/pull/3)
integrated at `3f6b9281239df72ae5182cf20fb389eefe4b563c` restores the original
Function Practice assignment before Probability Events and Random and Number
Guesser. Each has a complete brief, an intentionally incomplete starter and a
separate reference. Starter reminders exit with status 2 and provide no answer
results. The unrelated vector extension is archived without replacing the three
required assignments.

Arithmetic domains prevent signed overflow in the console exercise. References
convert before averaging, sum two independent dice, advance one seeded engine,
validate guessing ranges before drawing, count five valid guesses, and distinguish
invalid-input cancellation from a loss. Random tests verify domains and repeatable
runs on one library, without a cross-library sequence or fairness claim.
All 29 source methods and 45 native targets passed exact-head review checks and
independent [source-main CI](https://github.com/instruction-material/CPP-Level-1/actions/runs/37371616259).
The initial main attempt could not acquire a runner; its retry passed.

The matching neutral compiler instruction was refined in
[source PR #4](https://github.com/instruction-material/CPP-Level-1/pull/4),
integrated at `90c349525c22a157bff333c6160adbd9815ed7ae`. All nine brief copies
agree and the reviewed/integrated trees match. Both exact-head native gates
passed; C++ program and archive bytes are unchanged. The browser pin uses this
integrated tree, with all sixteen early Level 1 starter-file digests verified.
Independent [source-main CI](https://github.com/instruction-material/CPP-Level-1/actions/runs/37378148296)
also passed for that published revision.

The catalog candidate preserves that learning sequence and all three full briefs,
with separate starter/reference links and legacy progress aliases. Complete math
and random demonstrations are lessons rather than supplemental quota tasks.
The random reference remains available through its explicit lesson link.
Copy normalization preserves the person implementing the program rather than
rewriting that subject as "the work", and keeps capitalization in neutral role
labels. All thirteen focused foundation/functions catalog checks and source lint
pass locally. Browser coverage now includes all eight early C++ Level 1 starters
alongside the seven bridge starters, plus strict compilation of both new supplied
lesson examples. The fifteen workflows and both new lesson examples passed on
candidate `a3b01aad6630c017c6b8fc2dd364dbeb7326c888`, and Function Practice desktop
and Number Guesser mobile screenshots were visually inspected. Its full catalog
gate exposed the compiler-guidance wording and an overly broad grammar check
that rejected the valid term "distribution mappings". The same compiler edit
is present in the complete site briefs; the grammar check retains its specific
generated Scratch-copy guards. All six focused functions/copy checks pass.
Final [site PR #134](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/pull/134)
integrated at `43fe8fa02f88fbbba3cd6325fb6d8eef41b713e8` with identical reviewed
and integrated trees. All final review gates and independent
[canonical-main CI](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/actions/runs/37379859042)
and CodeQL passed. The combined first-three-module milestone is published as
[v2.8.33](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/releases/tag/v2.8.33).
Its original hosted ARM64 archive and manifest passed independent signed proof
verification pinned to repository, workflow, exact revision and annotated tag,
with self-hosted runners denied. All 7,843 payload files, thirteen trusted source
files, safe unique entries and one verified hardlink passed streamed checks.
Uploaded and published asset identities, sizes/digests and notes match exactly;
release `404135608` is immutable. No production activation is claimed.

[Downstream PR #24](https://github.com/instruction-material/classes.jacobdanderson.net/pull/24)
publishes exact canonical parent plus one preserved 75-file overlay at
`7c3677b1c72c5d889d7b0cbef7dcfcee50a71376`. Its full reviewed CI and CodeQL passed;
an explicit lease protected the observed old downstream main. Neutral branding,
example configuration, shared static assets and absence of analytics integration
are preserved. Downstream tags and releases are unchanged. Independent
[downstream-main CI](https://github.com/instruction-material/classes.jacobdanderson.net/actions/runs/37381448453)
and [CodeQL](https://github.com/instruction-material/classes.jacobdanderson.net/actions/runs/37381448557)
passed for the published overlay commit. CPPF4–CPPF8 and the broader audit stay open.

## Verification authority

Functional regression tests exercise confirmation, remote and local failure,
retry, unchanged existing work, Java source import, source-size limits, preview
cache separation, bounded directory traversal, and course resource links.
Repository-native lint, typechecking, full CI, and exact tagged release provenance
remain the delivery gates. The transcript review has a separate evidence boundary
in [zoom-followup-review.md](zoom-followup-review.md).

The broad audit remains open for assignment-level source correctness, full
course purpose and content review, justified duplication, original-source
identity reconciliation, and workflow verification across supported environments.

## C++ class-project candidate

[Source PR #5](https://github.com/instruction-material/CPP-Level-1/pull/5)
restores Person Class and separates Cat starter/reference packs. At reviewed
source `dcddc25f01a3b168a2b45d06b75799f7bf1bd408`, all 38 independent methods,
50 active native builds and separate CMake targets passed both hosted gates.
All archived source trees match the original tree exactly. Every Person public
method is implemented; the initializer lesson retains that API/output. Cat uses
the authored default breed and exact age-one pluralization while preserving its
original fictional signed-age example. Makefiles choose one program and avoid
duplicate root/starter/reference definitions.

The site candidate restores the original Point concepts, required Person,
member-initializer lesson and required Cat sequence. Complete multi-file examples
remain readable references, two full project briefs use distinct starter/reference
links, and no supplemental quota tasks are added. Source integration is verified
at `b5fc424b527e1e5ab99353d243e37d1cfd602f88`, whose tree matches reviewed source.
Independent [source-main CI](https://github.com/instruction-material/CPP-Level-1/actions/runs/37382353527)
passes. The neutral brief follow-up in
[source PR #6](https://github.com/instruction-material/CPP-Level-1/pull/6) integrates
at `174217a8af1077febd7bc59943aa501f9a2bb1e9`, also matching the reviewed tree.
Its independent [source-main CI](https://github.com/instruction-material/CPP-Level-1/actions/runs/37384742261)
passes all 38 methods, 50 native targets, sanitizer checks and separate CMake
targets. All 24 starter-file digests use this exact source pin, with the earlier
sixteen and every C++ program file unchanged by the wording correction.

The shared student-view formatter previously split fenced programs on blank
lines, trimming indentation and deleting code paragraphs that contained an
instructor-note string. It now cleans prose separately and preserves code fences,
including their blank lines, indentation and literal strings. Python and multiple
fence-delimiter regressions exercise the actual student store. All twenty focused
formatting/early-C++ tests pass; source/browser lint passes. Both complete
multi-file lesson programs compile warning-clean and match independent output
fixtures. The full browser gate additionally edits, saves and reopens each Person
and Cat header, implementation and driver before certifying their exact exports.

At candidate `c2c058ab29911287c93f8a00cde0635367c9c85a`, all seventeen actual
browser workflows and eight complete lesson programs passed. The retained Cat
desktop and Person mobile workspace screenshots were visually inspected. The
functional suite caught two third-person brief sentences; both source and site
copies now use the neutral instruction "Trace the same". All five focused
copy/class checks pass. The authored-practice regression also includes CPPF4 in
the explicit early-module contract, retaining the supplemental-project floor for
other courses. Final full site checks remain required before integration.
CPPF5–CPPF8 and the broader audit remain open.

Candidate `3dd401ca8f081dfecb5c64a743f8beeb3c34fa87` passes all 1,321
functional tests. Its separate catalog suite exposed a retired lesson-title
expectation and an overly broad split-status wording guard that also rejected
the valid instruction not to compile root, starter and solution copies together.
The regression now checks the actual Point header/source lesson and retains
specific administrative boilerplate guards. All 267 catalog-quality checks pass
locally with those corrections. Final exact-head hosted gates remain pending.

The final [site PR #135](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/pull/135)
integrates at `b86910ba923a115847324b052214a32a5b549e06`, with a tree identical
to reviewed head `6d37fd76d620ffd78b6fd64c3490b4091062ab03`. All 1,321 functional
and 267 catalog-quality methods pass. API checks pass 303 methods with 41 existing
database-dependent skips. All seventeen pinned starter workflows, eight complete
lesson programs, exact exports/native compilation and eleven Cypress checks pass.
Independent [canonical-main CI](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/actions/runs/37386899508)
and [CodeQL](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/actions/runs/37386899327)
also pass. Qodana skips its token-dependent analysis.

The milestone is published as
[v2.8.34](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/releases/tag/v2.8.34).
Its original tagged hosted ARM64 archive and manifest pass independent signed
proof checks pinned to repository, workflow, exact source/signer revision, tag
and hosted runners. All 7,843 payload digests, thirteen trusted source files,
safe unique archive entries and one verified prior-file hardlink match. Uploaded
and published asset IDs, sizes/digests and notes are unchanged; release
`404169331` is immutable. No production activation is claimed.

[Downstream PR #25](https://github.com/instruction-material/classes.jacobdanderson.net/pull/25)
publishes exact canonical parent plus the preserved 75-file overlay at
`9ad34102d9a4dcf3915db9d416259d4124ed1332`. The normalized overlay patch matches
without semantic edits. Full reviewed checks and independent
[downstream-main CI](https://github.com/instruction-material/classes.jacobdanderson.net/actions/runs/37387901620)
and [CodeQL](https://github.com/instruction-material/classes.jacobdanderson.net/actions/runs/37387901061)
pass. An explicit observed-main lease protected publication. Neutral branding,
example configuration, shared static assets and the analytics boundary remain
intact. Downstream tags and releases are unchanged.

## C++ collection-project candidate

[Source PR #7](https://github.com/instruction-material/CPP-Level-1/pull/7) integrates
at `e729baca982fc3683ef4f42f38fc72e05d3ca974` with the exact reviewed tree.
Vector Practice and Bank Accounts have complete, equal root/starter/reference
briefs, deliberately incomplete starter reminders, separate references and
one-program Makefiles. Both remain required in the deliberate vectors-first
Level 1 module; raw-memory work remains in Level 2. The complete vectors example
retains its original tracked program bytes and supplies a readable lesson.

Bounded integer collections establish safe int sums; ASCII length semantics
avoid a Unicode character-count claim. Bank Accounts validates count before
allocation and each complete integer amount before reporting any balance.
Missing, malformed and out-of-range fields cancel with status 1. Zero counts and
negative withdrawals remain valid fictional exercise data. All 48 independent
methods, 54 native targets, sanitizer checks and separate CMake builds pass
both review gates and independent
[source-main CI](https://github.com/instruction-material/CPP-Level-1/actions/runs/37388438560).
The integer-spelling follow-up in
[source PR #8](https://github.com/instruction-material/CPP-Level-1/pull/8) removes an
unstated 64-character limit that rejected bounded values with long leading-zero
spellings. Six focused native fixtures pass with sanitizers and warnings as
errors. Full [push](https://github.com/instruction-material/CPP-Level-1/actions/runs/37389384785)
and [review](https://github.com/instruction-material/CPP-Level-1/actions/runs/37389513865)
gates pass 48 methods and 54 separate native/CMake targets. The correction
integrates at `78fdf38f1c4f2163c12ffc206f8024d58a740647` with the exact reviewed
tree; all 28 starter-file digests and both project briefs plus the complete
vector lesson match that final site pin. Independent [integrated-source CI](https://github.com/instruction-material/CPP-Level-1/actions/runs/37389906217)
also passes.

The matching site candidate keeps both existing project identities, full briefs,
separate nested starter/reference links and the complete vectors lesson. Generic
quota duplicates are omitted. Nine focused collection/Level-1 flow methods pass;
the two targeted neutral-copy/authored-practice checks also pass (84 unrelated
methods skipped). Source/browser lint and syntax pass. Browser coverage is extended to nineteen
starter workflows and nine complete lesson programs. Full hosted site validation
remains required before delivery. CPPF6–CPPF8 and the broader audit stay open.


The first collection review head passes all 1,325 functional methods and all
nineteen actual browser workflows, nine complete lesson programs and eleven
Cypress checks. Bank/mobile and Vector/desktop screenshots are visually checked.
One of 267 quality methods rejects the literal TODO starter marker in otherwise
complete briefs; no unfinished assignment copy is found. The follow-up renders
that marker as inline code and checks placeholder prose outside code literals,
with explicit valid-literal and invalid-prose regression cases. The focused
quality method passes locally (186 unrelated methods skipped).

[Source PR #9](https://github.com/instruction-material/CPP-Level-1/pull/9) changes
only that markup in six equal root/starter/reference briefs. Both full source
gates pass at reviewed `670905540454c96133aa7f87adbbf4482a5b6df0`; integrated
`9632a5db7e3519ab72bb84f7cdc189f4e4af9397` has the identical tree. All 28 starter
file hashes match the final site pin; only the two README digests change, with
program, lesson and archive bytes unchanged. Final exact-head site gates remain
required before integration.


The final [collection site PR #136](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/pull/136)
integrates at `a4dda64e6eddbd6412e0ff030e2bf91bef2544c8`, with a tree identical
to reviewed head `9b71444bf4ac98653fb223d8ffbac3d32157f292`. All 1,325 functional
and 267 catalog-quality methods, 303 API passes, nineteen actual starter
workflows, nine complete lesson programs and eleven Cypress checks pass.
The 41 existing database-dependent checks remain skipped. Independent
[canonical-main CI](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/actions/runs/37392531630)
and [CodeQL](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/actions/runs/37392531733)
also pass; Qodana skips its token-dependent analysis.

The collection milestone is published as
[v2.8.35](https://github.com/anderson-webops/classes.jacobdanderson.net/releases/tag/v2.8.35).
The original hosted ARM64 archive and manifest pass independent signed proof
checks pinned to repository, workflow, exact source/signer revision, annotated
tag and hosted runners. All 7,843 payload digests, thirteen trusted source files,
safe unique entries and one verified prior-file hardlink match. Published release
`404194350` is immutable with unchanged uploaded asset identities, sizes/digests
and notes. Production activation has not been performed.

[Downstream PR #26](https://github.com/instruction-material/classes.jacobdanderson.net/pull/26)
publishes that exact canonical parent plus the preserved 75-file overlay at
`d3e6f1d06876a56d6a0763a763fe1b030cc6986d`. Its full reviewed CI and CodeQL pass,
including 1,333 functional methods and the same catalog/API/browser gates.
Independent [downstream-main CI](https://github.com/instruction-material/classes.jacobdanderson.net/actions/runs/37393541485)
and [CodeQL](https://github.com/instruction-material/classes.jacobdanderson.net/actions/runs/37393541018)
also pass. The exact overlay, neutral defaults, analytics boundary and dependency
locks remain intact. Publication used the observed-main lease and the authorized
one-time offline hook fallback; global hooks and downstream releases are unchanged.

## C++ parameter-passing candidate

[Source PR #10](https://github.com/instruction-material/CPP-Level-1/pull/10)
integrates at `f4648ea457a587715dd33667f62e539c84d15406`, matching reviewed
`2c8177810c4fc8eb6e36c553bcb6ed05f5cb56f8`. All 58 independent methods, sixty
warning-clean native targets, sanitizer checks and separate CMake builds pass
both reviewed gates and independent
[source-main CI](https://github.com/instruction-material/CPP-Level-1/actions/runs/37392488583).
The original complete introduction and Student-record program bytes and archive
are unchanged.

Parameter Passing Tracing retains supplied helpers while leaving predictions and
the driver unfinished. Defanging defines exact literal expansion, const-input
preservation, empty helper inputs and console cancellation. Chaos Monkeys bounds
original-byte traversal, preserves copy/reference/observer boundaries and states
its random-letter domain without uniformity or cryptographic claims. All three
have equal complete root/starter/reference briefs, incomplete status-2 reminders,
distinct references and one-program Makefiles. The old tracing starter remains
self-contained for previous direct imports.

The catalog candidate restores all three original required projects, including
Chaos Monkeys, whose old supplemental progress ID is retained with a new core
alias. The two complete supplied lessons are readable on the site; they are not
presented as unfinished starters. Generic practice quota duplicates are omitted.
The source pin uses the integrated tree: all 28 previous starter-file digests
remain identical, with six new pinned files. Browser coverage grows to twenty-two
starter workflows and eleven complete lesson programs.

The displayed Student-record program exposed copy cleanup changing source
comments. Prose cleanup now preserves fenced and inline code across neutral
wording, legacy branding, visible formatting and grammar; short code examples
retain their line structure during enrichment. Regression fixtures check comments,
strings, surrounding prose, backtick/tilde fences, longer and unclosed blocks and
inline literals. Exact-head full site and browser gates remain required before
integration. CPPF7–CPPF8 and the broader audit remain open.


The first parameter catalog head `5ae6ed39a1bb20c72e7870ae5d2413b129f4c12b`
passes all twenty-two actual browser workflows, eleven complete lesson programs
and eleven Cypress checks, plus build, typecheck, lint, accessibility and CodeQL.
The functional sweep exposes two copy-check follow-ups: a raw-source pattern
mistakes a preserved supplied-program comment for generated course prose, and
sentence rewrites cannot cross inline-code boundaries when each fragment is
processed independently. Raw scanning now decodes TypeScript string literals
and excludes code from prose checks, with valid-code and invalid-prose fixtures.
Inline code is masked for a whole-sentence copy pass and restored exactly.
All twelve focused course-copy/parameter/fidelity methods pass locally. Screenshot
capture returns to the start of the source after verifying the saved edit, so
workspace review shows imported code rather than an ending blank line. Final
exact-head full validation remains required before integration.
