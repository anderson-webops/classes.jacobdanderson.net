# Graph Sketcher Browser Integration

## Decision

The original GraphSketcher cannot be deployed directly on the Classes Linux
host. Its shared model and user interfaces are Objective-C code coupled to
Cocoa, UIKit, OmniGroup frameworks, and an Xcode 5.1-era build. The most
substantial upstream fork modernizes the macOS application but remains
Apple-only. A newer JavaScript project with the same name is an unrelated chart
maker, not a port.

The Classes integration is therefore an independent browser adaptation. It
keeps graph editing in Vue, TypeScript, and SVG and never starts a drawing,
conversion, or compilation process on the back end. The Linux server only
serves static frontend assets.

## Compatibility Base

The browser editor follows the portable, versioned `.graphsketch` JSON model
used by the maintained Avalonia desktop port. Common documents preserve:

- canvas size, background, padding, and legend placement;
- linear and logarithmic axes, grid settings, titles, and tick spacing;
- point series, line and marker styles, fills, labels, and error bars;
- text and simple shape annotations.

The browser also imports plain-XML and ZIP-wrapped original `.ograph` documents
on the client. Imported files are never overwritten.

## Runtime and Safety Boundaries

- Expression plotting uses a small parser; it does not call `eval` or
  `Function`.
- Imported projects are normalized and bounded to 8 MB, 128 series, 100,000
  points, and 2,000 annotations.
- ZIP import extracts only `contents.xml` and rejects oversized entries.
- Autosave uses browser `localStorage`.
- SVG, PNG, CSV, and `.graphsketch` exports are generated in the browser.
- No GraphSketcher route, model, or export operation is implemented in the
  Express API.
